# Animations, Subtle Effects and Cross-Browser Compatibility

CSS3 offers a whole lot of interesting functionality that you didn't know about but will really help you make your sites into something special.  Just be conscious of browser compatibility issues -- some of these aren't available on older browsers.

## Points to Ponder

* How do you round corners of a box?
* How do you add a shadow to a box?
* How do you rotate an element a specified amount?
* What interesting animations can you use in CSS3?
* What are pseudo-elements and what are they useful for?
