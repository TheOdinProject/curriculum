# CSS3 Best Practices for Layouts

This is a brief catch-all section designed to make sure you understand not just what elements and selectors and attributes you **CAN** use, but which ones you **SHOULD** use in each situation.  When you go visit several "normal" webpages (preferably one that isn't too massively corporate, since they do some abnormal stuff), there are a lot of similarities in the way they are structured (which you can see in your developer tools).  They all tend to judiciously use container divs for grouping elements and they use classes and IDs as necessary to determine styles.

You'll also get the chance to review what was covered in previous sections by checking out [LearnLayout](http://www.learnlayout.com) and doing their exercises.

## Points to Ponder

* What is a "container `<div>`"?
* When should you use `<span>` vs `<div>`?
* When should you use `id` vs `class`?
* What are good situations for breaking out styles into multiple classes?
* How can you use margins for alignment?

## Your Assignment
