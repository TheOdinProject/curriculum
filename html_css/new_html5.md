### Introduction

HTML5 brought in a lot of nice new features, many geared specifically towards giving webpages the ability to display media and interactive features more easily.  The downside is that there are still browser compatibility issues with some of that functionality, but that will get sorted over time.  Another set of new features is the use of more semantic tags in your markup so you don't need to put a `div` around everything (you can use the `aside` or `footer` etc).

### Learning Outcomes
