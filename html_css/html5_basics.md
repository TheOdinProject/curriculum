### Introduction

Most of this should be review since you've already completed the [HTML and CSS Foundations courses](/courses/foundations#html-foundations) (Right??) but it's a good idea to make sure you've got it covered so you make sure you're starting from a strong base.  It's impossible to separate HTML from CSS, so there will be some overlap before we get heavily into the CSS in later sections.

### Learning Outcomes
