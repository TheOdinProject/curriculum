### Introduction

Most of this should be review since you've already completed [the Web Development 101 HTML/CSS Lesson (Right??)](web-development-101/lessons/html-and-css-basics) but it's a good idea to make sure you've got it covered so you make sure you're starting from a strong base.  It's impossible to separate HTML from CSS, so there will be some overlap before we get heavily into the CSS in later sections.

### Learning Outcomes

* What are element attributes?
