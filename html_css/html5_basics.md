# HTML5 Basics

Most of this should be review since you've already completed [the Web Development 101 HTML/CSS Lesson (Right??)](/web-development-101/html-and-css-basics) but it's a good idea to make sure you've got it covered so you make sure you're starting from a strong base.  It's impossible to separate HTML from CSS, so there will be some overlap before we get heavily into the CSS in later sections.

## Points to Ponder

* How is an HTML5 document structured?  
* What are elements/tags? 
* What are element attributes?  
* How do you link to external files?  
* When should you use IDs vs Classes? 
* What attributes are required by image and links for them to be effective and accessible?  
* Where should your CSS live?
