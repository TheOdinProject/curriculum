### Introduction

Meet Flexbox. The CSS3 Flexible Box, or more widely known as Flexbox, is a new and powerful layout mode in CSS3. It provides us with a box model optimized for laying out user interfaces. With Flexbox, vertical centering, same-height columns, reordering and changing direction is a breeze. This is  thanks to its layout algorithm being direction-agnostic (as opposed to the block layout, which is vertically-biased, or the inline layout, which is horizontally-biased).
Flexbox is pretty easy and straightforward to use. However, implementing it on more complex layouts can get a little out of hand so it should only be used for small application components and simpler layouts.
