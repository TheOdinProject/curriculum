### Introduction
Ordered and unordered lists are heavily used in most websites.  It's not just for bullet-points and numbers... they are also used in creating horizontal navbars and long collections of objects (like a list of pictures of items for sale).  They often take the place of tables as the method of choice for displaying structured content.
