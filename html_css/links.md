### Introduction

Links are the glue holding the web together, so make sure you understand how to properly link to external websites AND internal files.

### Learning Outcomes

* What's the difference between internal links (/somepage) and external links (http://www.somesite.com/somepage)?
* When on a webpage should you use the full URI (with the `http://yoursite.com/somepath`) and when should you use the relative path (`/somepath`)?
* How do you navigate the document tree with links (../../someotherpage)?
* How do you open links in external windows?
* What are all the possible pseudo-states (e.g. `:hover`) of a link and when are they actually activated?  How do you change styles based on them?
