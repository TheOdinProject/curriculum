### Introduction

HTML Tables allow you to create two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns. In this lesson, you will learn everything you need to know about HTML Tables.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

- Create advanced HTML tables.

### HTML Tables

Some data just really needs to be displayed in a table. HTML tables might be less commonly used than buttons, links, lists and everything else you've learned so far, but there are some cases where they're the _perfect_ tool. Some of the more advanced features can get a little tricky to set up correctly but getting started with tables is pretty easy. You create a table with `<table></table>` tags and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers, or anything else that's possible inside those table elements.

For example: 

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-slug-hash="JjrYEqX" data-editable="true" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

In this codepen example we created a table element, containing two table row elements. The first row has two headings while the second row has 2 data cells.
