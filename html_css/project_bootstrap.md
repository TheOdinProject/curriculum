### Introduction
In this project, you'll get a chance to try out Twitter's Bootstrap framework by building a site that actually uses it -- [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/).

### Assignment
Note: As usual, ignore any ads, icons, and interactive elements (which use Javascript).  If you really want to grab icons, try taking a screenshot of them and making an image file out of that.

1. Go to [newsweek.com](http://www.newsweek.com) and have a look around.
2. Follow the instructions atop the [Google Homepage project](/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) to set up a Github repository for this project (of course you'll need to change the title).
3. Create a new HTML document.
4. Think about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.
5. Add Bootstrap to your project by following the instructions at [GetBootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/).  Use the examples on that page as templates for how to organize your page.
5. Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and which are positioned by using the appropriate Bootstrap classes.
6. Set up the top title and navigation bar.
6. Work your way down the page by filling in and positioning the additional sections.
7. Try resizing the browser to see if it mimics the behavior of the real Newsweek homepage.
7. Push your solution to Github.
