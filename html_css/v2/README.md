We are in the process of completely rewriting all of our HTML and CSS content, from scratch.  Our current curriculum relies too heavily on freecodecamp, which many of our students report is somewhat of a slog.  Additionally, much of our later content is getting somewhat dated, so we are in need of a refresh.

You can see what we're working on [here](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/projects/2).

This directory is where that new content lives.  Before starting work on one of these lessons _please_ get in contact with us [on discord](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB). And get the appropriate issue from the above project board assigned to you.
