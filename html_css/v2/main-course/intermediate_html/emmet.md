### Introduction

Emmet is a plugin, built into VSCode, that helps you write HTML and CSS more efficiently by providing a bunch of clever shortcuts. By now, you have written a good amount of HTML and CSS, and if you have been using vscode there's a big chance that you have already encountered emmet in some way.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

- Use some of emmets most useful shortcuts.
- Set up custom emmet keybindings in vscode.

### Emmet

Emmet is a really useful tool for anyone that works with HTML and CSS a lot and luckily does not have that big of a learning curve because if you already know how to write HTML and CSS you'll have no trouble picking up emmet abbreviations.

Let's start off by generating an HTML boilerplate with emmet. Opening up an empty html file in vscode and entering `!` should trigger emmet suggestions like so:

Pressing enter should generate the following text:

We have just used one of many emmet abbreviations. There are lots of useful emmet abbreviations that you should check out, like <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/actions/wrap-with-abbreviation/">Wrap with Abbreviation</a> and <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/actions/remove-tag/">Remove Tag</a>. Definitely go through those before moving forward.

Considering how useful these two are, we will be setting up vscode shortcuts for them.
Start off by opening the keyboard shortcuts window. You can do so by clicking the icon on the bottom left and selecting keyboard shortcuts, or by pressing `Ctrl K` followed by `Ctrl S`.

After entering the keyboard shortcuts window, you should be able to access all of the emmet actions by searching for `Emmet:<action>`. In our case, it will be `Emmet:Wrap With Abbreviation`

You can now add a shortcut to it by clicking the plus sign and entering whichever key combination you would like for that specific action.
You can do the same for `Remove Tag` by searching for `Emmet:Remove tag`.

2. Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/">Emmet cheat sheet</a>. You don't have to memorize it, but it's good that you get familiar with the different ways it can be used.
3. Go through the <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/">Emmet documentation</a> Once again, no need to memorize everything but it would be good if you played around with all the different possibilities.
