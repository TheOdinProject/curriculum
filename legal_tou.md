### Description of the Platform

The Platform is a learning service which displays content from third-party sources and allows registered users to participate in discussions. Registered users of the Platform may contribute content, data or information (“Content”). The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to discussions.

We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, release new versions of our Website, or introduce other services and/or features for the Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms of use that we may release for those specific services or features. 

### Your Odin Project Account

You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to certain Services is only available to registered users.

When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, a username and password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid. 

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password, and you will remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account, whether or not such activity was authorized by you.

We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of Use, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable laws or regulations.

You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination section below.
