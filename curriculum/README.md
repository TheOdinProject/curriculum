# Welcome to The Odin Project Curriculum:

The Odin Project (also known as TOP), is an open-source community for learning full-stack web development. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive curriculum to learn web development for free. We help our students to learn the skills and build the impressive portfolio of projects they need to get hired as a web developer.

The curriculum is divided into distinct courses each covering the subject language in-depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give students the opportunity to practise what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the student's portfolio.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repository houses the curricular content used in [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) website. (cf. [this repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject) which houses the front-end and back-end code.)


The TOP community can be found in our [gitter chat rooms](https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

## Contributing

The Odin Project depends on open-source contributions to improve, grow and thrive. We welcome contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds to help maintain this awesome curriculum and community.

### Lessons/Courses in Development
We are constantly making improvements to the curriculum, it is very time consuming to write new lessons and it's done for free. New lessons are always in the works. If you would like to know specifics, please checkout the [Fourm](https://forum.theodinproject.com/) under "sprints", ask in the [gitter chat contrubuting section](https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/Contributing), or keep an eye on this repo.

If you would like to help us develop any lessons please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/wiki/Contributing-Guide) to find out how you can contribute.

#### A non-exhaustive list of what you can contribute to help us:
* Typo and grammar corrections.
* Rewriting lesson sections to make them clearer and easier to understand.
* Fixes for broken links.
* New resource links you think would make a lesson better
* Working on new lessons and projects, you can can choose to work on parts of a lesson which are outlined in the progress list on [lesson plans](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22new%20lesson%22%20) or you can work on completing an entire lesson yourself.

# The Odin Project - Javascript Curriculum

## Mission statement

**Our main focus** is the cultivation and sequencing of best free resources around the internet. We believe wholeheartedly that everything one needs to know to become employed can be found for free online, but for the average new learner, the vast amount \(and widely varying quality\) of resources makes it difficult to make a meaningful progress.  We have devised a three basic steps to fix this.

1. We have created a curriculum that attempts to find the optimal sequencing of information. This curriculum is intended to take someone from knowing literally nothing about Web Development to a point where they could be employed as a Junior Developer.
2. For each topic in the curriculum we try to find the best free resources on the internet to teach that topic.  We will often link multiple resources, thereby not relying too much on a single source of information.  If good resources can not be found, we write our own, but we definitely prefer primary link to external sites.
3. We invent and cultivate projects that give learners a chance to practice what they have learned and integrate skills along the way, which increases information retention, giving the learner a chance to experiment and allows the learner to build an impressive portfolio.

Additionally, we have made our learning materials completely open-source.  This means that if anyone comes across a resource that is better than what we currently have included in our lessons, that person is free \(and encouraged!\) to add them, which improves our curriculum over time, and helps it to stay up-to-date.
