# Problem Solving
A brief summary about what this lesson is about and why the topics or concepts it covers are important.

## Learning outcomes
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

what the student is expected to know or be able to do by the end of this lesson

* Learning outcome 1
* Learning outcome 2
* Learning outcome 3

## The Problem solving Process

First
* Identify the big picture goal - what problem are you trying to solve?
* How will you interact with the software? sketch the interface

Then
* whats the smallest possible feature you can build to get started?
* pseudo code for the feature
* Implement
* repeat

## Deep Dive into Pseudo Coding
* what is it?
- plain english representation of the code you will write
- also known as an algorithm

* how to do it
- step by step sequence starting from the top like a recipe
- show examples of pseudo coding a problem
