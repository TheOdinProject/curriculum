### Introduction

Welcome to Ruby Building Blocks!  Since you've already done a decent chunk of Ruby in the [Web Development 101 Course](/web-development-101/ruby-basics) (if not, go do that first!), this should start as a healthy refresher of what you've already learned with *Variables, Data Types, Strings, and Methods*.  

But this lesson will take you much deeper and further than you went before, so don't think you've got a free pass.  There's a whole lot of stuff to cover.  These first couple of lessons cover the broadest swathe of material of the entire Ruby course, so get stretched out and warmed up, it's time to dive in!

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

  1. You should have already completed [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) in the Web Development 101 course to start with.
  2. Do the full [Codecademy Introduction to Ruby section](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-d1Ylq/0/1) from their [Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby).
  3. Complete the [Codecademy Introduction to Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-MxXx5/0/1) project ("Putting the Form in Formatter")
  4. Read [Beginning Ruby](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-Ruby-Professional-Peter-Cooper/dp/1484212797/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475608118&sr=8-1&keywords=beginning+ruby) Chapter 2: `Programming == Joy: A Whistle Stop Tour of Ruby and Object Orientation`
  5. Read [Beginning Ruby](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-Ruby-Professional-Peter-Cooper/dp/1484212797/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475608118&sr=8-1&keywords=beginning+ruby) Chapter 3: `Ruby's Building Blocks: Data, Expressions, and Flow Control` pages 29-46 (only the section on Numbers and Expressions and the section on Text and Strings)
  6. Take a look at the [Ruby Date and Time explanation from TutorialsPoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_date_time.htm).  No need to memorize all the Time Formatting Directives, just know what they are and where to find them.
  7. Do this great little [Regex Tutorial](http://regexone.com/) and the example problems (should only take an hour or so)
  8. Glance over this list of [Escape Characters](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/doc/syntax/literals.rdoc#strings) in Ruby and keep it for future reference.  You'll probably only end up using `\n` newlines and `\t` tabs.

### Test Yourself
Note: If you want to actually write and run your own Ruby code, you can either use IRB from the command line (type `irb` after the prompt), or run it from a script file using `$ ruby ./your_file_name_in_the_current_directory.rb`, or use the online editor at [repl.it](http://repl.it/languages/Ruby).

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
  1. Make sure you can do the [Beginner Ruby Quiz #1](http://www.codequizzes.com/ruby/beginner/variables-strings-numbers) from [Code Quizzes](http://www.codequizzes.com/).
  2. Make sure you go back up and look at all the questions from the "Points to Ponder" section.  See if you can do most of them without looking back through the text.

### Additional Resources
This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something.

* If you still don't understand certain topics or don't like my summary, look them up in the [Bastard's Book](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/)
* Read [Learn Ruby the Hard Way Chapters 1-5](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex3.html) for a basic treatment of numbers.
* Read [Zetcode's Data Types section](http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/datatypes/) for a bit more depth on the subject.
* [Alex Chaffee's brief writeup on Objects](http://codelikethis.com/lessons/learn_to_code/objects)
* [Ruby Inheritance](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_inheritance.html)
* If you prefer video, Treehouse has a [free video on numbers](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/ruby-foundations/numbers/creating-numbers)
* Read [Zetcode's Strings section](http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/strings/) for an in-depth look at strings.
* Read through (and watch the video) for this [Regular Expressions in Ruby](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/ruby-for-newbies-regular-expressions/) explanation.
* Read the [zetcode Arrays chapter](http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/arrays/) for some more in-depth knowledge.  Don't worry too much where they talk about blocks or the `select`, `collect` and `map` methods, we'll cover that in a later section.
* Read [Zetcode's Hashes section](http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/hashes/) for some more depth on hashes.  Again, don't worry too much about `map` and other block-taking functions.
