# Git 101
<!-- *Estimated Time: 2 hrs* -->
<!-- purpose of this lesson should be to give the student a bit of a plain english overview of what git is and how to do the basics, eg make a repo, init, stage, commit and push. It would be nice to have a full blown git course -->

<!-- this course would be better after the installations project, that would allow students to have a bit of an idea of what they are doing when the submit their projects -->

<!-- notes for my editing this lesson
two things this lesson should do,
1. provide a high level overview of git
2. explain the basic work flow of staging, commiting and pushing

Make sure to get the point across that git can feel cumbersome and unintuitive at the start, to not worry about understanding everything about git. The students will get more comfortable with it as they use it, git is a passive skill that will improve over time with use and understanding the basics is enough for now. They will learn more of the advanced features of git as and when they need them. 

the reason we are introuducing git now before we have git into coding is for a few reasons.
1. the sooner the student understands the basics, the sooner they will get comfortable with git
2. they will be able to upload the coming projects to github with at least a basic understanding of what they are doing
3. having your projects on github will allow them to get help easier from others, as they can just share a link to thier repo to share thier code when they need help
4. start builing a git profile.

We mentioned Git briefly in the previous course [Introduction to Web Development](/introduction-to-web-development/tools-of-the-trade) and you've had a chance to use it during the [Rails project](/web-development-101/ruby-on-rails) but now it's time to actually dig in a bit more and understand what Git really is.

To get a good high-level overview of Git plus a series of how-to commands and explanations, check out [Getting to Know Git](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-to-know-git).

## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What is Git?
* What is SCM?
* What is a VCS?
* Why is Git useful for a developer?
* Why is Git useful for a team of developers?
* How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?
* How do you create it on Github?
* How do you commit changes?
* What is the difference between staging and committing changes?
* What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?
* How do you check the status of your current repo in git?
* How do you see the history of your previous commits (from the command line)?
* How can you look through your historical commits on the Github website?
* What is a "Merge"?
* What is a "Pull Request"?
* What is "Forking" a repo?
* What is "Cloning" a repo?

## Assignment:

1. If you haven't already, watch the following videos (which were linked in the post above as well) from [Github's Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/GitHubGuides):
    
    1. [Git Basics #1: What is VCS?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo) will introduce you to version control for developers.
    2. [Git Basics #2: What is Git?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhtzxPU7Bz0) will start getting a bit more into a Git workflow.
    3. [Git Basics #3: Get Going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmnSyrRBKTw) will show your how to configure your git initially.  You likely did some of these steps during the installation phase, so don't download it again.
    2. [Webcast: The Basics of Git and GitHub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4) will provide more of a linear and wholistic look at practical workflows when using Git.  Some of the early terminology is a bit developer-y and it is pretty wide-ranging, but just soak it in and save it for later.  You'll also see information about some helpful Help files and GUI tools to visualize Git.

1. Do the [Git Calisthenics](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/git-calisthenics) exercises for a follow-along walkthrough of pretty much everything you'll need with Git during the next few months.
2. Do the quick [Try Git exercises](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) as well.
