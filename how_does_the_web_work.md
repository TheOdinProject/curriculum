# How Does the Web Work?
<!-- *Estimated Time: 1-2 hrs* -->
<!-- update: Web Developer Tools moved to new lesson. -->

Before you can understand how to *program* the web, you need to understand the web itself on a more granular level than you probably do now.  Some of this stuff is necessary just to have a more holistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working (and to not sound like a total newbie when talking to other developers about it).
  
## Learning Outcomes
*At the end of this lesson you should be able to:*

* Describe what the *internet* is
* Describe what *packets* are and how they are used to transfer data
* Understand the differences between a *webpage*, *web server*, *web browser* and *search engine*
* Briefly explain what a *client* is
* Briefly explain what a *server* is
* Explain what *DNS servers* are
* Explain, in your own words, what happens when you **click search** on google.com to a friend!

## Assignment:
1. Watch this [BBC short](https://vimeo.com/128575085)  for an overview of how the Internet works.
2. Supplement this with a [reading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work#Summary) and a [video](https://youtu.be/7_LPdttKXPc?t=46s).
3. Read up on the [differences](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#Summary) between a webpage, web server and a search engine.
4. Watch this [Google short](https://youtu.be/BrXPcaRlBqo) explaining what what a web browser is; then find out what web browser you are using right [now](https://whatbrowser.org/).
5. Now read about how one part of the web [interacts with another](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works#Clients_and_servers) and [read](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name#How_does_a_DNS_request_work) or [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA&feature=youtu.be&t=45s) a DNS request in action.
