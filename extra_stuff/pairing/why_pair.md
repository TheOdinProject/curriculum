# Why Pair?

## The major benefits of pairing to learn are:
* Learn by teaching, the most effective method
* Get through bugs faster
* Ask questions of a real human
* Get realtime feedback on the code you're writing
* It forces you to focus and remove distractions

## Things that are difficult about pairing:
* There's an element of personality fit between partners
* You need to get used to thinking out loud
* You need to get used to teaching instead of just grabbing the keyboard and doing things
