#Project Workflow
^ Blurb about setting up basic workflow items: ie, git and a decent text editor /vomit /rofl gedit

##Points to Ponder
^ ?? Drop notepad and gedit you fools.

##Your Task
Pick your text-editor, choose wisely - this will be a close companion of yours for awhile. (Or get both!)
- Sublime Text:
  - For [Windows](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
  - For [Linux](http://askubuntu.com/questions/172698/how-do-i-install-sublime-text-2-3)

- Atom:
  - For [Windows](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.9.0) - scroll to the bottom of the page and download *AtomSetup.exe*
  - For [Linux](https://codeforgeek.com/2014/09/install-atom-editor-ubuntu-14-04/)

And install Git:
- For [Windows](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/windows); Steps 2 and 3.
- For Linux: [installation](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/linux) - do step 2 (it's only one line); [configuration](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/configure_git) - the whole page; make an [SSH key](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/create_an_ssh_key) and make a [Github account](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/create_a_github_account)

##Additional Resources
^ Seems like overkill; maybe some git resources if absolutely necessary or some ideas about package manager on the text editors:

Really useful for workflow!!
- [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
- Packages to look at: [Random Everything](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Random%20Everything), [Emmet](http://emmet.io/)

### Git

Git, the version-control system you've read about, is another tool that requires a brief install.  You'll also be asked to create your Github account, which is very important because it'll host your portfolio.  When people visit your repo on Github (if it's public), they see all the source code files you've uploaded.

### Text Editor

We recommend using a text editor like [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to make sure everyone's using basically the same type of text editor and you'll all be able to work together and ask questions of each other without that getting in the way.  Sublime also has lots of handy shortcuts, code highlighting and other nifty features that'll make your life easier, and that's just on the surface.

Check out [this "Quick Guide to Sublime Text" from Jennifer Mann](http://jennifermann.ghost.io/a-quick-guide-to-sublime-text/) for some helpful hints and tricks.  She refers to [this tutorial (~2.5 hrs of video) from NetTuts](https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/) which explains some of the awesomeness of Sublime Text 2 in depth.  The first chunk of the video is the most important, don't stress out about picking up the details in the rest (but you should come back to it once you've gotten more comfortable with the editor).

##Additional resources
* [Guide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9440639/sublime-text-from-command-line-win7) for opening Sublime Text via command line in Windows.
