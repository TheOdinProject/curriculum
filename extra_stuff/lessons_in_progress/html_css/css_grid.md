[//]: # (This lesson is outdated; CSS Grid Layout exists, and this misleads the learner to believe that this is one and the same. This uses a variety of CSS properties to create a horizontal grid system, which is not a 2D grid layout.)

### Introduction

"Flexbox and Grid are not opposing technologies. They work well together. If you are looking to create a one-dimensional layout or for a component, use Flexbox. If you are looking to display content on both the x-axis and y-axis as a two-dimensional layout, then use CSS Grid. You can have a grid layout with a flexbox component inside."

I like this resource. I really do. From what I've seen, this guy Chris Coyier writes some really good content.
It really shows and helps one understand how one could create a division system.
However, it is outdated, and now 'CSS Grid Layout' exists.
I feel this misleads the learner to believe that this construction of a grid system is the same as the native CSS Grid Layout.
