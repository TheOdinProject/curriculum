# Pair Programming and Remote Pairing 
Total estimated time: 1-3 hours

## Intro

Students often haven't heard of pair programming when they first start learning development.  It certainly seems to counter the image of the rainmaker developer who hacks away on his own into the wee hours of the morning.  

For a long time, pairing was primarily the domain of a dedicated but minority set of programmers who followed the [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) (XP) and the debate continues about whether and how to use pairing for production code.  More recently, however, the use of pairing as purely a learning tool has exploded and it's much harder to argue against the benefits and evidence of its effectiveness for that purpose.

Pair programming is when two programmers work on the exact same code base.  Often, in the real world, it is done by simply passing the keyboard and mouse back and forth when it's time to switch.  Typically, one person (the "driver") writes the code while the other person (the "navigator") watches, thinks several steps ahead, makes suggestions and catches typos and bugs.  

In production settings, this results in better code and helps developers stay focused.  Despite tasking two developers to produce one code base, the gains in quality and speed make up for the loss of two separate builders.  But the two developers will also be constantly learning from each other, constantly thinking through problems together, and constantly staying engaged with the task at hand.  That means two developers pairing together can potentially learn many times faster and more effectively than they would on their own.  

This curriculum is designed specifically to benefit from and encourage the use of pair programming as a learning tool among peers.  The projects won't be easy and a single sneaky bug can frustrate you for hours on your own.  But with a pair, you're often able to get past the issue in a fraction of the time.  Any time when you're not quite 100% confident of your knowledge but want to dive into a project anyway (which we encourage!), having a pair sitting either right next to you or 1,000 miles away using a screenshare can be invaluable. 

You'll end up working with a lot of different types of people over the course of your learning.  Sometimes it will go really well and other times you'll have to find patience.  But, overall, your learning experience will be greatly enriched by the chance to both learn from and teach to your peers along the way.
