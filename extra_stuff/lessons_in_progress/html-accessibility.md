# Accessibility

One of the most important and oft overlooked aspects of designing for the web is accessibility.  Approximately 15% of all internet users across the globe have some sort of disability, including sensory things such as blindness or deafness and more physical things such as motor impairment that could make using a computer in the traditional manner more difficult.

Because of this, there are several tools that people with disabilities must employ in order to effectively use computers such as screenreaders or alternative input devices.  However, for these tools to work properly, with your website, there are a few details to attend to.

Obviously, in the end the nature of your projects is going to determine whether or not accesibility is important to you.  Simple toy projects and experiments will not benefit from considering these issues, but if your goal is to work for or create something that is going to be used by many people across the net you will _need_ to know how to deal with these things.

## Points to Ponder

* What is a Tab-Index?
* What is "Aria"?
* Why is contrast important?
* Why are alt-texts on images important?
* What are the different kinds of disabilities that might effect the way people interact with a website?
* What are the different ways people could access or interact with a website?
* Why is good HTML important to having an accesible website?
* What might be some legal ramifications to having an inaccesible website?
* Why are ethical considerations more important than legal issues?
* How will you cultivate accesibility as you practice your craft?

## Your Assignment

1. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qjgxH384Nc) about accessibility on the web.
2. Read [W3C Buisness Case](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview), Overview, Social, Techincal, Financial, and Legal & Policy Factors.
3. Check out the [W3C accessibility specifications](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)
4. Read [Ethics for Programmers?](https://www.brandonsavage.net/ethics-for-programmers/)
5. Read [Asssociaton of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct) Section 3 and 4 are specific to ACM members.
6. Read [12 Ethical Dilemmas gnawing at developers today](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2607452/application-development/12-ethical-dilemmas-gnawing-at-developers-today.html)
7. Try accessing the sample app you built using the Hartl tutorial using a screen reader.  Windows 10 has [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798/windows-10-narrator-get-started) built in.  Mac has [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/).  Linux has [various resouces](https://opensource.com/life/15/5/accessibility-linux).  After you are familiar with the screen reader, try donning some saftey googles with vaseline lightly smeared over it and see how well you can naviate with diminished vision.  (Don't forget to take them off before getting up and walking!) Note where the app succedded and failed in aiding you.  Keep this in mind as you develop in Odin and what this means for you when you develop in the real world.  Will accesibilibity be a core value for you whether you free-lance or are part of a team?  Ethics are part of any professional endeavor.  And it is important to begin to cultivate them while preparing for a profession.
