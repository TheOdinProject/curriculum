# Accessibility

One of the most important and oft overlooked aspects of designing for the web is accessibility.  Approximately 15% of all internet users across the globe have some sort of disability, including sensory things such as blindness or deafness and more physical things such as motor impairment that could make using a computer in the traditional manner more difficult.

Because of this, there are several tools that people with disabilities must employ in order to effectively use computers such as screenreaders or alternative input devices.  However, for these tools to work properly, with your website, there are a few details to attend to.

Obviously, in the end the nature of your projects is going to determine whether or not accesibility is important to you.  Simple toy projects and experiments will not benefit from considering these issues, but if your goal is to work for or create something that is going to be used by many people across the net you will _need_ to know how to deal with these things.
