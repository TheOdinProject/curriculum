# Project: Choose your OS!
Blurb about operating systems and how Windows is garbage and isn't free like Ubuntu. Why would you shell out $100 for an OS? Choose Linux and you've earned yourself 20 cups of on-the-go coffee. Maybe talk about what an operating system actually does?

## Why you Should use Linux for this Course
You can use the Windows operating system and have no problems whatsoever with learning HTML CSS and Javascript - you will run into big issues when you try to use Ruby on Rails. The programmers who created Rails had a preference for unix based operating systems (OSX, Linux) this means learning Rails on a Windows machine is a recipe for frustration. Below are some of the main reasons for using Linux when learning Rails:

* Because of the fundamental differences between unix based operating systems and Windows, installing Rails on a Windows machine is likely to give you problems that you would not encounter if you were installing on a Linux system, these can be a real pain to solve.

* The above point extends to the different gems you will be using with Rails in the future. Most of the latest updates to gems will be targeted at unix based systems, they may eventually get patches to make them work with Windows but some may never get updated to work on Windows.

* Because of the instability of Rails on Windows you will probably find yourself second guessing some of the errors and bugs you encounter when developing being caused by either your system or the code you have written.

* Most of the examples throughout the learning process will assume you are using  Linux or Mac, *you will have to spend extra time* translating these into the equivalent Windows commands yourself if you stick with Windows

* Most of the Rails community use unix based systems, this will make finding help with set up and configuration problems very difficult if you are installing on Windows. In fact the most common response you are likely to get is "install Linux".

* **Bonus**  Experience with Linux will look great on your CV.

We at Odin don't have anything against Windows, *we simply want you to succeed at your goal of learning to program*. We don't want to see you get majorly frustrated and giving up on this first hurdle of getting everything installed. Therefore *we unequivocally recommend using Linux or a Mac for this curriculum*.

### Installing Linux
The good news is installing Linux is not as hard as you might have imagined, first of all Linux is free so you don't have to pay for anything Yay!. Secondly there are three different options that you can choose from to use Linux on your machine along side Windows, so you can choose the one that suits your situation best.

There are many different versions of Linux out there and many people who have used Linux for any length of time will have different opinions on which one is best. We wont go into any of that here and will simply recommend you use **[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)** which is generally known as one of the most beginner friendly versions as well as having a very similar graphical user interface to Windows.

####Option 1 - Dual Booting
You can install Ubuntu along side Windows on your machine by dual booting. This essentially means when you boot up your computer you will brought to a screen that will allow you to choose which operating system you want to use, either your Windows operating system or your new Linux operating system. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz66FC0pWU) is a guide of how to set this up.

**Pros**

* Gives you access to both Windows and Linux
* This option will yield the best performance from Ubuntu as it will be installed directly on your hard drive.
* You can customise as you like with different text editors etc

**Cons**

* Messing up your Windows installation is a possibility when setting your computer up to dual boot (this is difficult to do)
* To switch between your two operating systems you will have to reboot your computer.

####Option 2 - Use a Virtual Machine
A Virtual Machine is essentially a program that runs on your computer that emulates another computer system. If you have any experience of using emulators to play games that were released for old games consoles, this will be familiar. If not [here](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/virtual-machine-makeuseof-explains/) is a very good explanation of what a a virtual machine is. You can [download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_DpFhT_euI) guide to set up this option.

**Pros**

* You can access Windows and Linux, with the extra benefit of being able to switch between the two instantly.
* No risks to messing up your windows installation by doing something wrong with a dual boot
* You can customise as you like with different text editors etc

**Cons**

* Performance with Ubuntu won't be as sharp as a dual booting

#### Option 3 - Using an Online IDE
There have been some great online IDE's(Integrated Development Environment) released in the past few years. These are similar to Virtual machines, in fact that's how they are set up in the background. The difference is they are websites so you can only use them in your browser. Of course this means you can log in from any computer and start coding from your browser when you have access to the internet. [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) and [Nitrous](https://www.nitrous.io/) are two of the most popular online IDE's.

**Pros**

* You don't have to install anything on your local machine (this can be a con depending on the way you look at it, experience installing and setting stuff up on your local machine can be invaluable)
* Your coding environment will be available from any machine with internet access.

**Cons**

* You have to use the text editor that their services provide, which generally are not as good as the text editors you can install locally. Atom, sublime text etc.
* The free tier's of these services have a memory limit, normally 1 gb. This can be a major limitation after a while.

## Oh no! Total Failure!!!

If all else fails, the best web-based development environments to use for coding the back end are [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io) or [cloud9](https://c9.io/).  They are free to use and give you a brand spanking new Ruby and Rails setup to start coding with.  

They rely on having an internet connection, but they give you a command line, a text editor, and the ability to run a local server right out of the box.
