#Gearing up for success
Learning how to program is hard, it is not an easy skill to acquire and it can't
be learnt in a weekend or month for that matter. With that said before we get
into the meat of the curriculum it would be beneficial to go over the things that
will help you succeed in your goal of learning to code and the pitfalls that you
should try to avoid.

## Mindset
Your mindset is very important when teaching yourself any new skills not just
programming, It has more of an impact of your chances of success than just about
anything else.

We will look at getting clear about what your motivation for learning
programming is and getting yourself into the growth mindset so that you
have the right mentality when approaching challenges through out the curriculum.

###Your Motivation For Learning Programming
Your motivation to learn to code could be to have a fulfilling career that pays
well, it could the creativity outlet programming provides, it may be to have the
skills and ability to build any sort of app you can think of, it might be to start
your own company by turning an app idea you have into reality. It may be a
combination of these reasons or something else entirely.

Whatever the reasons you have for learning to program you should take a moment to
think about what it is, It will be what pulls you through to the end of this
journey and gives you a definitive goal to aim towards.

To give your motivation a bit of a boost you can read about the success of others:

###The Growth Mindset
There is a wide body of research that supports that intelligence is not fixed,
it can be developed. People usually fall into one of the following two mindsets

**Fixed Mindset**
Someone who believes if they don't get something on their first attempt they never
will and that they aren't smart enough to be able to do or understand some things.

**Growth Mindset**
Someone that believes they can get better at anything with effort and persistence.

What does this mean for you? it means you can learn new skills and develop new
talents with persistence and grit. There will be many times throughout Odin
that you will be stuck with a concept or a programming problem and may find
yourself questioning you ability to learn programming.

When you find yourself in this position, remind yourself that you may not get it
*yet* but with persistence and grit you will. Struggling with something is
growth, it doesn't matter how long you struggle with a concept or project all
that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through, thats how
real learning happens.

While you're working through the curriculum embrace the struggles you encounter
with learning difficult concepts and completing projects. And celebrate your
persistence at overcoming those struggles.

When you find yourself questioning your ability reflect on the successes you have
already had while learning to program, the projects you have completed and the
concepts you at one time didn't understand but now do. This all the proof you need
that you can do it.

## The Best ways to Learn
Odin's curriculum has two fundamental aspects, you will be assigned resources
to read, watch and do in a lesson. These are comprised of resources we have
gathered up from around the internet, the reason why we do this over rolling
our own material for everything is because this allows us to utilise the very best
resources that have been created by experts in their field that are authorities
in what they are teaching.

Most of these lessons are followed by projects that allow you to practice and
solidify the concepts you have just learnt about in the previous lessons.
Most of the projects will give you a description of the problem you have to solve
or the website you have to build. This allows you to be as creative as you like
with the solution with little hand holding.

You will learn by doing with Odin, it's the only way you can truly learn programming.

### The Process of Learning
The way we have structured out curriculum with lessons and projects is consistent
with the best ways of how to effectively learn. Learning involves understanding
concepts and practicing them to solidify your understanding by using the concepts
in a context where the concept is relevant.

When learning your mind will consistently switch between the following two states:

**Focus mode**
when you are actively focused on learning, reading, watching videos, working on
a project.

**Diffuse mode**
when you are not actively in a learning activity, doing the dishes, exercising,
sleeping etc. When in this state your mind goes about the business of connecting what
you have been learning to the other things you know. This is where break throughs
happen.

It's important to know that your mind goes through these two states to learn
because you can utilise this to make your learning more efficient. When stuck on
a concept or project taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious go to work
connecting what you are learning together more often than not leads to a solution
to your problem.

In short understand it, practice it, and finally teach it.

Teaching what you know to others is a great way to solidify what you have learnt
and can often reveal holes in your knowledge that you wouldnt have identified
otherwise. You can use our [slack chat](http://www.theodinproject.com/chat) to practice
this method of learning by answering questions and helping students who are not
is far in  the course as you are.

To learn more about effective ways to learn, [learning how to learn on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) comes highly
recommended.

### What to do when you are stuck
You will inevitably be stuck at some point in the curriculum, it may be due to
a concept that you are having difficulty understanding or it may be due to
something not working when you are doing a project. What ever it is use the
following processes to get unstuck:

* Google it - you can be sure someone else out there has had the same problem as
you at some point, a quick google can often lead to a solution.
* Take a break - allow your diffuse state to work on the problem.
* Ask for help in our [chat](http://www.theodinproject.com/chat) - come prepared
with your research done, people will be more willing to help you when they can see
you have already put effort into trying the figure out the solution.

## Managing your Study Time
You will have more success with Odin by putting consistent time into it rather
than working on it every other day. Building a habit of studying everyday at
a specific time and for a specific amount of time will ensure you make consistent
progress.

### How to Avoid Procrastination
Procrastination will be your biggest enemy when trying to make progress, this how
to avoid it:

**Use the Pomodoro Technique**
The pomodoro technique is a way of managing your time in order to stay focused.
You basically set a timer for 25 minutes and work on a task until the timer goes
off. You then take a 5 minute break and go again for 25 minutes once your break
is over.

If you get distracted or interrupted during the 25 minutes you have to start the
25 minutes of work over again.

The pomodoro technique is great for avoiding procrastination as it forces you to
work without distractions and it's only for 25 minutes before taking a break
so it's not overwhelming which makes it harder to rationalise procrastinating.

To learn more about the pomodoro technique read this [great article](https://medium.com/skhack-life-2-0/multiply-your-productivity-with-pomodoro-eeac2645a78e#.clvcxxyk8)

**Avoid Digital Distractions**
digital distractions are email and Facebook notifications, time wasting websites
like social networks. These kinds of distractions break your focus and make it tempting
to procrastinate they should be avoided during study time.

solution:
turn off notifications and add a blocker to your internet to limit time on time
wasting sites like Facebook.

**Avoid Physical Distractions in your Environment**
Physical distractions are distractions from your environment, things like a TV in
the background, other people speaking etc. These are just as much a nuisance to
breaking your focus as digital distractions.

solution:
Find a quiet study place in your home you can go to to focus, if that's not an
option you can use noise cancelling head phones to block out any noise distractions
from your environment.

## Pitfalls to Avoid
The following are some of the pitfalls that beginners often make when learning how
to program, try your best to avoid these.

###Don't get pulled into rabbit holes
Because we cover so much material on Odin and link to so many high quality outside
courses and tools it is easy for students to get pulled into rabbit holes by
spending time trying to learn all there is to know about a subject that they aren't
ready for or wont have much benefit to them. We have put a lot of effort into
structuring the curriculum so that all of the important things that you need to
know about web development are covered exactly when you need to know them.

To get the best results from this curriculum try to stick to the path laid out
as much as possible and try to limit time spent going down rabbit holes as these
sidetracks can really ruin your momentum.

###Don't compare yourself to others
Measure progress against yourself and don't compare yourself to others. Students
often compare themselves against others who are further along in their coding
journey or have more experience. This is a recipe for depression and frustration.
Only compare yourself to your past self, can you do or know more than you did
last week, month or year? then you are making progress.

###Conclusion
Learning any new skill is a journey full of speed bumps and obstacles to be
overcome, We hope that the principles here will help you as you go
forward and put you in a much better position to succeed and get the most out
of Odin. Without further ado, lets get stuck in to learning web development.
