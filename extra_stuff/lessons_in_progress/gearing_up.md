#Get into the right mindset to learn

Learning to program is a marathon not a sprint, it is a journey full of ups and downs, struggles and triumphs. To get to the finish line you need grit. Grit is a combination of motivation and persistance, with it you can overcome any challenge.

###Your Motivation For Learning Programming 

This could be to have a fufilling carrer that pays well, it could the creativtey outlet it provides, it may be to have the skills to build any sort of app you can think of, it might be to start your own company by turning a app idea you have into reality. It may be a combination of these reasons or even something else entirely.

Whatever the resons you have for learning coding this is where your motivation for learning coding comes from. Because you are here reading this on this site I am assuming that you have your reason for learning coding sussed out.

There are things that you can do to boost your motivation for learning programming though,

Get inspired by reading blogs of others who have successfully taught themselves programming:

Watch some great TV, movies and documentaries about programming
> watch silicon valley
> watch halt and catch fire
> watch the social network
> watch indie game

Read some great books 
> steve jobs, love him or hate him but without him the tech industry would not be the same
> Masters of doom - about the guys who created doom and quake, if you want to code 
> inovators - the history of computing and the stories of the masters
> Hackers - the guys responsible for modern computing and video games


the growth mindset
There is a wide body of research that supports that intellenge is not fixed, it can be developed.

What does this mean for you? you can learn new skills and develop new talents, with persistance and you can learn anything This is called a growth mindset. There will be many time's throughout this curriculum and after in your programming carrer that you will be stuck with a concept or a programming problem and may find yourself questioning you ability to learn programming.

When you find yourself in this position, remind youself that you may not get it *yet* but with persistance and grit you will. The only way you can fail is if you give up.

While your working through the curriculum do not focus on the struggles you encounter instead celebrate your persistance at overcoming those struggles and completing projects and learning concepts

Reflect on what you have done, when you find yourself questioning your ability reflect on the successes you have had, the projects you have completd and the conspets you at one time didnt understand but now do.

remember "failure is not a permament condition" you just havent succeded yet.

# the best ways to learn
focus mode
when you are activley trying to learn,

diffuse mode
when you are not activley in a learning activity, 

when your learning, you go through two different

learning involves understanding concepts and practicing them to solidify your understanding by using it in a context where the concept is relevant.

when you are stuck on Concepts:
different explanations
look for metaphors
turn away from the problem and allow you diffuse state to work on the problem, I bet there have been a few instances in your life when you had a problem and you couldnt think of a solution, when you went away from the problem and did something else all of a sudden a solution appears from almost out of seeminly no where.

When you are stuck
when stuck on when learning a concept
if the resources provided arent doing it for you, do some research on the net to get other explanations. Go on the slack chat to ask for help 

when you are stuck on a project or programming problem
> spend some time on it,
> utilize google
> ask for help in the slack chat
> when completly stuck have a look at the other solutions

understand it, practice it, teach it
> teaching is a great way to master what you know and shore up holes, help out in the slack chat.

This is what we do here
Our curriculum has two fundemental aspects, you will have be assigned resources to read, watch and do in a lesson. These are comprised of resources we have gathered up from around the internet, the reason why we do this over rolling our own material is because we decided that the resources created by experts in thier field is better than anything that we could come up with, we are standing on the shoulders of giants in this respect and many of the resources are created by people that are authorities in what they are teaching.

Most of these lessons are followed by projects that allow you to practice the concepts you have just learnt about. Most of them will give you a description of the problem you have to solve, this allows you to be as creative as you like with the solution.

Dont get pulled into rabit holes


- learning to learn techniques, getting away for a while when stuck
- how to go about getting help, googling and asking for help
- go into the set up here shoulders of giants and learning by doing
- dont get pulled into rabbit holes 

## deep work and how to avoid procrastination
Your ability to focus has a lot to do with eliminating distractions, distractions manifest themselves in two domains, digital distractions like email and facebook notifications, time wasting websites like social networks and reddit.

solution:
turn off notifications, add a blocker to your interent to limit time on time wasting sites.

Physical distractions are distractions from your enviroment, things like a tv in the background, other people etc.

solution:
noise cancelling earphones
go to the library or coffee shop to study if thats an option
Find a study place in your home you can go to to focus,
