# Contributing Guide

Thank you for expressing interest in contributing to our curriculum!
Please also ensure you carefully read everything here: https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/wiki

If you would like to contribute, but are not sure how, find an [issue tagged with "help wanted"](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/labels/Help%20Wanted) to work on.
* Please comment on the issue stating what you'd like to work on and wait to be assigned before working on it.
* After being assigned, address each item listed in the acceptance criteria.

Feel free to use [this markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet) if you are unfamiliar with the markdown syntax.

If you would like to propose a small change (fixing a typo, updating a link, etc.) that is not part of an existing issue, you are welcome to make the change and submit a PR.

If you would like to propose a change that is not covered in an open issue, please start by creating a new issue or discussing this in our [Discord's contribution-suggestions channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/505093832157691914/540903304046182425).

## How to Contribute

1. Fork this repo on your local machine.

	* Fork and clone this to your local machine. Use [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you don't know how to do that.
	* Set the upstream remote so you can keep your copy of the app synced with the original. To do that, go to your terminal and `cd` into your cloned curriculum directory. Then, use one of the following commands:

	If you have ssh set up with Git
	```
	$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:TheOdinProject/curriculum.git
	```
	Otherwise
	```
	$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum.git
	```

2. Before you start working on your issue, create a branch and name it like the following examples:

	If it's a new feature
	```
	$ git checkout -b feature/feature-name
	```
	If it's a bug fix
	```
	$ git checkout -b fix/fixed-bug-name
	```

3. When you have finished, commit your latest changes and ensure your markdown is correctly formatted and rendering properly using our [markdown preview](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/preview) tool.

4. If the markdown is correctly formatted, you are ready to submit a pull request:

	**Push your branch to your fork**
	```
	$ git push origin <your branch name here>
	```
	**Create a pull request**
	* Go to your fork on Github after you have pushed up your branch. A new button should be visible near the top of the page. It will allow you to create a pull request to the original Odin Project repo.

	* Please fill out the pull request template in its entirety.

	* Summarize the change in the pull request title, so that anyone can skim through our open pull requests to prevent making a duplicate PR. As a general guideline, the title should summarize the change and where it happened, for example: "Fixes punctuation in Clean Code lesson", "Updates specificity link in CSS lesson", and "Adds code example to Ruby Variable lesson".

	* Describe the changes in detail and explain why you think they are necessary and/or important.

	* If the PR is related to an open issue, use a [relevant keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) and reference it with the `#` sign and the issue number. For example: "resolves #1234".

	* If changes are requested, please make the changes in a timely manner. After you submit the changes, request another review from the maintainer (top right).
