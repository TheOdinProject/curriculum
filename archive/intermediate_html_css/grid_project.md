### Introduction
We've covered a lot of ground so far! Now it's time to practice the Grid tools we've learned and create a layout that might seem familiar. We're going to make a Holy Grail Layout like the one we created using Flexbox in the Landing Page project. The difference here is that we'll be creating a version of the Holy Grail layout that is slightly more complicated. We won't be relying on Flexbox for this project. We'll only be using [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/), and you'll be able to see the benefits of Grid for yourself.


### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Have a look at the layout you'll be creating [here](https://i.postimg.cc/5y5Km7V1/Holy-Grail-Two-Column-Layout.png). Think about how the grid is arranged, and how you'll want to create a similar layout using **fixed sizing**.
2. Create a new HTML document and write up the basic structure of the page using empty `<div>` tags to act as each of the grid items.
3. Start out by creating explicitly positioned Grid item sizes to fit your screen. Refer back to the *Positioning Grid Items* lesson if you get lost on which properties you can use to accomplish this. Once again, you're only using Grid - no Flexbox. 
4. Change your Grid to be responsive using the techniques you learned about in the *Advanced Grid Properties* lesson. 
5. Now that it's responsive, we're going to have some fun making it a bit more complicated and adding some features. Have a look at and try to create [this layout](https://i.postimg.cc/4xfqWgy0/Holy-Grail-Final-File.png). You might find this to be a bit more challenging than you expected, and you might want to use Flexbox. For the sake of this practice assignment, try and see if you can figure out how to make your layout to look similarly using only Grid. Feel free to use your own dummy content.
5. Push your beautiful new grid to GitHub and share your solution below!
