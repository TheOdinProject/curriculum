this lesson describes how to run javascript code in various contexts including online (repl.it, codepen, jsbin), included in an HTML file (on the page and included as a script), in the browser (devtools) and in a terminal (node)

All of these JS environments are useful in their own ways so the lesson should highlight when and why each is appropriate.
