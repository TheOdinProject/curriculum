The very first steps of learning any programming language are destined to be at least a little frustrating.  It's normal to feel lost and confused as you progress here, because no matter where you start in the material, there are definitely crucial elements of the language that you just have not been exposed to yet.  Having said that, we've _really_ tried to find the best materials to get you going as quickly and smoothly as possible. So embrace the cognitive dissonance, and let's go.

### Points to Ponder
* What are the 7 basic types in Javascript?
* What is a variable, and how do you declare one in Javascript?
* Can you name all 3 ways to declare a variable in Javascript and when would you want to use each one?
* What types of things can you store in a variable?
* What are the rules and guidelines for naming variables?
* What is 'Loose typing' and what does it mean for your code?
* How can you do math in Javascript?
* What's the difference between `=`, `==` and `===`?
* What is a string?
* How do you concatenate a string?
* What is an array?
* What types of things can you put into an array?
* How do you get items out of an array? (i.e. how do you use the information you've stored)

### Step One
1. [This tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) throws you into the deep end ðŸ”¥.  The point of it is to give you a good feel for what you're going to be able do to with your Javascript skills, and how to think about breaking down a problem.  You'll also get a good idea for what your code is going to end up looking like. You will not, however really learn a lot here.  Don't sweat it.  It's _just fine_ if you don't really understand what you're doing just yet.  You'll get there.

### Variables
You can think of variables simply as "storage containers" for data in your code.  Until recently there was only one way to declare and use a variable in Javascript (the `var` keyword) but the latest versions of Javascript include 2 more keywords that can be used depending on the situation. The following resources will tell you what you need to know!
1. Read through [this tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables). It only covers the first method of declaring a variable, but most of the information is relevant to the other methods as well. (Be sure to code along in your browser's console, or in the provided code boxes!)
2. Read through [this variable tutorial](http://javascript.info/variables) as well. It covers the other methods of variable creation.  __Be sure to do the Tasks__ at the end of this article!  Information won't stick without practice!
3. There is one quirk that you should be aware of when it comes to declaring variables.  In many cases you won't have to worry about this too much at all, but when it comes up it can definitely be a frustrating experience to debug if you don't already know about it.  Don't worry too much about it at this point, but read [this short article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#var_hoisting) about variable hoisting, and keep it in the back of your mind for now.
4. At the risk of giving you too much information [This article](http://wesbos.com/javascript-scoping/) explains the main difference between Javascript's old `var` syntax and the newer `let` and `const`.  You shouldn't be trying to internalize these small details yet, because frankly they're describing rules that you haven't encountered yet.

### Data types
1. There are a few extremely common types of data that you will encounter in Javascript, and the bulk of this lesson will give us a really strong foundation in all of them.  Before we start digging deep however, [this article](http://javascript.info/types) will give you a quick overview of the most common ones.

### Numbers
Numbers are the building blocks of programming logic!  In fact, it's hard to think of any useful programming task that doesn't involve at least a little basic math... so knowing how numbers work is obviously quite important.  Luckily, it's also fairly straightforward.
1. [This MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math) will get you started neatly. There's much more that you can do with numbers, but this is all you need at the moment.

### Strings
Depending on what kind of work you're doing, you might end up working more with pieces of text rather than numbers. A __string__ is simply a piece of text... and is a fundamental building block of the language.
1. Read and code along with [yet another MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings) on the topic. 
2. Go through [this lesson](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Useful_string_methods) to learn a little bit more about what you can do with strings.

> ## A little reminder: 
> By this point, your head might be spinning because of the amount of information you've tried to cram in. That's OK! Don't let it get to you. You are never going to retain all of this info on the first go.  All of these elements are fundamental building blocks of the language, so as you learn you will definitely be encountering them all over and over again, and as you do, it will begin to stick. Our advice for now is to make sure you're actually coding along with the lessons as you read them (which will definitely help with retention) and just press on.  When we've gotten through this stuff we'll give you a chance to slow down and practice what you've learned.

### Arrays
Strings and numbers may be our building blocks but, as you can probably imagine, as your scripts get larger and more complex you're going to need a way to deal with large numbers of them.  Luckily, Javascript has a couple of data types that are used for just that.  An Array is simply an ordered collection of items (Strings, numbers, or other things).
1. [This tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays) is a great introduction, and includes a couple of coding exercises for you. Be sure to do the exercises!  You'll learn more deeply how arrays work, and you'll also get some more practice working with the other elements we've been discussing.

### Getting Help!
We've learned a lot!  As we mentioned above, we don't expect that you will have retained all of this information on the first go through.  Your next step then, is to _practice_.  The more you use this stuff, the better you'll retain it.  However, as you begin trying to write some code you'll almost definitely realize that you have forgotten something along the way.  Knowing where to look online is a pretty useful skill.  Take a few minutes to check out the following sites.  Get used to their layout and be ready to come right back to them when you discover you've lost something.
1. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): this one should be familiar to you at this point...  it's the same site as most of the tutorials we've directed you to so far.  In addition to having great beginner tutorials, MDN also has very thorough and well organized documentation that even the pros use from time to time.
2. [http://javascript.info/](http://javascript.info/), the other site we've linked to is another good resource.  Most of the content takes the form of tutorials rather than documentation, but they're more concise, and good for review... and while looking around, you might learn something else along the way which is never a bad thing.
3. [GOOGLE](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=GOOGLE). Ok, we didn't really need to mention this one, but many times the easiest way to look for something is to simply google it.  At this point in you career you might have a harder time deciphering which information is relevant.
