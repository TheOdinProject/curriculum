### Warmup: Installations and Blogger

To do this course, you've got to have Rails and several other technologies [properly installed on your computer](/courses/web-development-101/installations).  That will be the first task if you haven't already.

Next comes the [Jumpstart Lab Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) (which was assigned way back in the Web Development 101 course).  The Blogger tutorial is actually more challenging than the project below, and was assigned to give you a chance to get in over your head a bit so you'd pay attention along the way :)

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
1. If you haven't already, do the [Installations project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/installations).  If you've already got Rails on your system, it's still worth skipping to the bottom and verifying that you've got **Rails 4** (at least) and **Ruby 2** working properly.  The section says:
    Even if you didn't use the Railsbridge installation instructions, verify your installation by following their instructions for [creating a sample Rails app](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/create_a_rails_app) and then [deploying it](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/deploy_a_rails_app).
2. If you haven't already, do the [Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html), and chapter 1 of [the Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning).
3. If you haven't done either of these, you should go back to the [Web Development 101](/courses/web-development-101) course and at least do the [Web Development Frameworks section](/courses/web-development-101/#section-web-development-frameworks).

### Project: Starting The RoR Tutorial

We will be using the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl throughout this course.  It is a complete, step-by-step walkthrough of building and testing a Twitter-like microblogging application.  It covers a lot of material but so does this course, so we'll be spacing out the chapters along the way to go with the appropriate lesson material.

Though this tutorial is a major common theme across all the coming lessons and serves to tie them together into one major project, we'll also be building plenty of independent projects along the way.

In this chapter, you'll build a simple scaffolded app on Rails.  It won't be as complicated as the Blogger Tutorial was and is really just to make sure your system is all set up and your brain is switched into Rails mode.

### Assignment
<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
1. Read and follow along with [Chapter 2 of The Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app) by Michael Hartl, where you will create a very basic Ruby on Rails application. Michael takes steps to standardize the development process by partnering with [Cloud 9](https://c9.io), but if you've done the installations listed above you should be good to go on your own machine. Michael also favors [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) over github because bitbucket has free private repos. If you choose to use bitbucket keep in mind that your solution will not be viewable unless you make the repository public.  If you feel a little lost, it might not hurt to go back and re-read chapter 1.
