# Project: Substrings

Implement a method `#substrings` that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument.  It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

### Example Output

```language-bash
    > dictionary = ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]
    => ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]

    > substrings("below", dictionary)
    => {"below"=>1, "low"=>1}
```

Next, make sure your method can handle multiple words:

```language-bash
    > substrings("Howdy partner, sit down! How's it going?", dictionary)
    => {"down"=>1, "how"=>2, "howdy"=>1,"go"=>1, "going"=>1, "it"=>2, "i"=> 3, "own"=>1,"part"=>1,"partner"=>1,"sit"=>1}
```

**Quick Tips:**

* Recall how to turn strings into arrays and arrays into strings.
