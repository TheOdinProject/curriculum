#How this course will work
This is a BIGGGGGGGGGG course.
It's big because the Ruby programming language is SOOOOOOOOOOO big.

<!-- The examples are complex so may be ommitted, I was just thinking that it's really important for newcomers to understand that what they think they are getting back from their logic is not necessarily what the computer is returning. (Computers are stupid so they only give back what you told it to give back)-->
Users should make a distinguishment between what a user 'sees' and what a computer 'sees'.
Examples:
- assumptions about what is being returned
- difference between puts and return

Pros:
It's object-oriented.
It reads like English.
Easy to pick up because of convention over configuration.

Cons:
Its processing power is weaker than other languages - benchmark vs Java?
