Hopefully you've gained a better idea of what a web developer actually does and what your life might look like if you decided to take it on as a career.  This has really just been a teaser into the world of web development.  See the "Additional Resources" section below if you'd like to learn more before moving forward to the next courses.

In the next course, "Web Development 101", you'll take a journey through the entire spectrum of topics that you will eventually need to know.  That will give you a great base from which to begin, though it's got a lot more meat to it than your typical "101", so watch out!

After that, each course will be a deep dive into a particular topic, from the back end to the front.  You will build dozens of scripts, projects, and websites by the time this journey is complete and will have the skills necessary to step into full-time development.  

Getting all the way there is going to be challenging.  In fact, you should check out the post ["Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard"](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) so you have a good idea of what the journey ahead is like.  But what worthwhile thing is truly easy?

Yes, it's going to be challenging.

But it's going to be fun.

And it might be life-changing too.
