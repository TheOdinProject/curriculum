### Introduction
Javascript doesn't really have "classes", per se, like Ruby -- instead they use "prototypes" to DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") up code.

You'll also find **Objects** used a whole lot.  They're basically containers that can contain anything from variables to functions (or both!).  They might remind you a lot of Ruby's hashes.  You'll find them used in standard ways (for logically grouping variables) or ways which may be new to you (to group functions within a particular namespace).

### Learning Outcomes

* How are JS objects similar to Ruby objects?
* Can JS functions be defined inside of objects?
* What is a `ConstructorFunction`?
* What is a prototype?
* How do prototypes allow you to inherit and DRY up code?
* What happens if you take the prototype of the prototype of the prototype etc. of an object?
