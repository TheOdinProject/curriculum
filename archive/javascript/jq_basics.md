### Introduction
You should already have completed the [Web Development 101 jQuery lesson](/web-development-101/jquery-basics), and this will really be a deeper coverage of each of those issues (much like Ruby Basics was for Ruby).

jQuery, of course, provides a very easy-to-use model for manipulating the elements on your page.  It also contains lots of helper functions and special libraries for doing things like building widgets or even mobile apps.  You get to benefit from all the lazy programmers before you who build these tools to make their lives easier.  Enjoy!

### Learning Outcomes

* What is a selector?
* What does the `$` symbol mean?
* Why is it often important to wait for the Document (DOM) to finish loading?
* How can you select a particular element on the page?
* How can you select only the `<li>` elements inside of `<div>` elements with class `test-div`?
* How are selectors actually pretty similar to the way CSS operates?
* What does a jQuery selector return?
* How can you manipulate the values (e.g. html, width, height...) of a selected element or elements?
* What does it mean that selected elements are "implicitly iterated over"? (Think if you used `$("div")` what would happen)
* How can you create new elements?
* How can you insert new elements into the DOM?
* How can you chain jQuery selectors?
* What happens to the elements you've already selected (e.g. with `$("li")`) if another qualifying element (e.g. a `<li>`gets added to the DOM later?
* What does "traversing the DOM" mean?
* How can you add CSS to a selected element?
* How do you add or remove data attributes from an element?
* What new iterators (including some familiar Ruby ones) does jQuery give you?
* How would you add the class `some-class` to every `<li>` on the page?
* How would you use `#map` to return an array listing the contents of a particular list?
* How is jQuery's `#map` almost identical to Ruby's?
* Where can you look up any selectors you need?
