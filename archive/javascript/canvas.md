### Introduction

Canvas is a great tool in HTML5 -- it basically provides a panel in which you can use Javascript and math to draw pretty much anything.  It's useful for everything from gaming to image optimization.  In our case, we'll focus on games because it gives you a chance to flex your pure Javascript muscles creatively.  For the first time so far, you'll get to build games that operate dynamically in 2-D space (not confined to a grid).  Use that power only for good...

### Learning Outcomes

* What is Canvas?
* How do you set up a Canvas element?

* [Canvas Deep Dive book](http://joshondesign.com/p/books/canvasdeepdive/toc.html) chapters 7-14 get deep into how you can use Canvas as a sweet graphics and gaming tool.  Out of scope for this course, but could be fun if that's your thing.
