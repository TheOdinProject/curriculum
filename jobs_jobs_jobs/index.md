# The Best Free Resources for Getting Hired as a Web Developer

You've been figuring out this web development stuff and building apps for a long time now and it's finally time to get paid to keep learning by working for someone else.  

You're absolutely capable of getting a job but it's rarely easy to find one.  You'll have to be honest with yourself about what you want and what you can offer and tackle the challenge of getting hired with the same rigor and structure that has gotten you this far.  

This is as much an odds game as anything is, especially for first-time employees who haven't been "proven" by past experience.  That means you'll get your fair share of rejection along the way but everyone does.  You just need to keep building your skills and portfolio to make yourself a stronger candidate while continuing to send applications and get yourself out there every day.  

This course (which is currently under construction) will lay out a structured path to follow which should help you avoid some of the pitfalls of just diving into the process without a plan.  Good luck and get after it!

## Strategy

The first step is to have a strategy.  You've come this far with a deliberate and strategic approach to learning, why abandon it at the most important phase?  Getting a job can itself be a full-time job so use your time wisely and plan ahead.  There are some things you can and should do ahead of time, which we talked about a bit in the [lesson on Getting Hired in the Introduction to Web Development course](/introduction-to-web-development/getting-hired-as-a-web-developer) but will cover in greater depth below.

The path to working takes the following form:

1. Figure out your needs and skills
2. Figure out what companies need and offer
3. Increase your odds by laying the groundwork early
4. Collect job leads
5. Qualify job leads
6. Reach out and apply
7. Interview
8. Handle the offer(s)
9. Profit??

You'll notice that it's quite structured.  Some things are more optional than others, but you've got to have a plan or you'll find yourself spamming your resume out to every job post on every job board and wondering why you haven't had any success. Or maybe you'll end up going through a long and painful process and realizing you never wanted that job anyway -- a total waste of time.

We'll also cover some alternate paths you can take like finishing up your education at a coding bootcamp and how you can contribute to open source projects (like this one) to boost your "real world" experience.

A fantastic place to start your "getting hired" journey is this **[very thorough article from Happy Bear Software on How to Get A Programmer Job](http://happybearsoftware.com/how-to-get-a-programmer-job.html)** (which was also a part of the Intro to Web Dev course).

So get your head out of the clouds, stop dreaming about how you'll get hired, and actually do it!

## It Starts with YOU

### Where You Are Now

Without defining what your own needs are, you will have no way of determining the right path forward so hunker down until you've got an idea of what your key needs are right now (from a job).  The questions below should help you think about what is actually essential for you versus nice-to-have.  Ask yourself:

* Why do I *need* a job?
* What kind of salary level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
* What kind of job security level do I need to sustain myself and my family?
* How desperate am I to get a job *right now*?

### Where You Want To Be

Once you've been honest with yourself about your needs, it's time to figure out what you *want*.  What will your future needs be?  What kinds of companies do you want to work at?  

* Why do I *want* a job in web development?
* What kind of career path do I want to have?
* Do I want to work in a developer-led organization (vs sales- or business-led)?
* Do I prefer working in a team environment or remotely?
* Do I like working long hours / weekends or 9-6?
* Is the work more important than the people?
* Do I have to care about the product I'm building?
* Do I have to care about the technologies I'm using?
* Do I prefer an "easy" work environment or one where I'm constantly pushed?
* Do I want "creature comfort" incentives like free food and beer at the office?
* Do I have to enjoy my work or can I power through a crappy job?

### Prioritizing Needs and Wants

You should have at least an informal list of the things that matter to you.  Now ruthlessly rank them.  What are your non-negotiables and what are your nice-to-haves?  Every company and opportunity will fall somewhere on the spectrum defined by those questions and they are the criteria you will later use to evaluate them.  This will help you stay focused when considering opportunities and not spread yourself too thin chasing things that you wouldn't really choose anyway.

Make sure you know every one of your "must-haves" and your top 5 priorities for "nice-to-haves" in a job.  

### What Are Your Assets and Liabilities?

It's time to be honest with yourself... what do you bring to the table?  If you're early in your career (which you probably are), you'll have to work hard to distinguish yourself from the flood of unqualified candidates out there.  You need to strike the line between being honest with yourself and not selling yourself short.  Everyone, especially those just starting out, feels unqualified.  That's natural, so don't worry about it.  This is about figuring out your strengths and weaknesses so you can tailor your story to play to your strengths and honestly address your weaknesses.

Some questions to ask (which you'll probably hear again in your early interviews):

1. How hungry am I?
2. How good am I at building back end code?
3. How good am I at putting together front ends?
4. Can I solve really technical problems like brain teasers and algorithms?
5. Have I built projects that display a good range of skills?
6. Do I know people who can recommend me?
4. Am I a good people person who builds relationships easily?
5. Do I portray an aura of confidence or act shy?
5. Do I tend to undersell myself and my capabilities?
5. Do I have a broad level of general tech knowledge?
6. Am I very familiar with a particular technical or industry vertical? (Usually career switchers have one)
7. Do I tend to procrastinate or do I just get shit done?
8. Do I wait to ask for help or do I go out and find the answer on my own?
9. Do I lean in to challenges or avoid them?
10. What are some really difficult problems I've solved before?

Applying without much experience means you need to fill in your weak spots and emphasize your strengths.  For almost everyone, your biggest strength will be hunger and ability to learn.  But companies have heard that story before, so you'll have to tie in other strengths that you can to make your story compelling.

A quick note -- there is a difference between hunger for opportunity and desperation.  Hunger is about seeking reward (which you can do when you're in a comfortable situation and optimizing opportunities) and desperation is about avoiding failure (which occurs when you absolutely MUST have that job).  Do whatever it takes to not sound desperate, even if you are.

## What Companies Want 

You can't get hired by just thinking about why *you* need or deserve the job.  You have to think about life from the perspective of the company.  Why are they interested in hiring you?  What, therefore, will they look for?

### Life Behind the Curtain

Hiring managers are busy people.  That's why they need someone new... to remove some of their workload and get their team working better or faster.   They also have to deal with potentially hundreds of unqualified applicants every week, which takes up too much of their valuable time.  They just want to get back to building stuff and not have to hire again anytime soon.  So they are looking for someone who can **add value as soon as possible** and who will be able to **grow with the organization.**

The second characteristic, growth, is something you shouldn't have much trouble selling if you've come this far and learned web development on your own.  The key is to present yourself as a growth curve, not just a static line (i.e. you'll continue learning and improving very rapidly and not stop).  You have real career goals and you've learned incredibly fast so far to get to where you are (right?).

The first part, adding value immediately, is more difficult -- that's where they want to see that you've had relevant experience before and can meet their technical bar.  There's a bit of a catch-22 with getting hired -- the easiest way to show you are employable is to have been employed before.  It's a check mark next to you.  So to cater to this; do whatever you can to show that other people have believed in you enough to use your work and skills.

Aside from those two characteristics, there is another major factor -- fit.  The hiring manager wants someone they and their team can work well with.  All the other stuff represents minimum hurdles for being considered.  But you often make or break your chances by being someone the team members want to know better and work with all day long.  Almost all hiring processes ask the full team to evaluate a late-stage candidate.

So to summarize, hiring managers are usually looking for 3 main things:

1. Capability
2. Motivation
3. Fit

You can learn a bit about the perspective of hiring managers by reading blog posts about how to hire developers.  No need to go crazy, but try to get a picture of why they're hiring you:

1. [The Best Way to Hire Software Developers](http://news.dice.com/2013/05/31/hiring-software-developers/)
2. [How to Hire Talent](http://lifeofaprogrammanager.blogspot.com/2006/06/how-to-hire-talent.html)
3. [Joel Spolsky has a lengthy diatribe on hiring developers](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FindingGreatDevelopers.html), which should give you an idea of the need and pain of hiring great engineers.
4. [Joel Spolsky's Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing 3](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html).  Look for "people who are 1. Smart, and 2. Get things done".

### Internships

A good way to start getting experience and show others that you're employable is to get an internship.  Just make sure it's a paid internship because no one values things they get for free.  You want the people you work with to value your contributions and feel like they have a stake in helping you succeed.  The good part is that internships tend to focus more on your growth potential than what you've done before, so you can start to avoid that chicken-and-egg problem described above.

The hiring process for internships is usually similar to but not quite as rigorous as full-time positions.  Internships are basically just long interviews by that company to see if they want to bring you on full-time.

## What You Can Do Beforehand (Way Beforehand)

Taking a structured approach to getting hired means starting early and getting some important things out of the way first.

### Get Good!

Navigating this process can be a beast but don't let it distract you from building your skills, which ultimately will determine if you get the job or not.

### Craft a Narrative

You may be uncomfortable "selling yourself" but that's exactly what you'll have to do.  Luckily, that doesn't mean acting like a used car salesman; it's more subtle than you think.  It really means crafting a story about who you are, how you got to where you are, and why you'll keep growing.  Everyone can tell a story.  So put some effort into crafting a compelling narrative that stitches together your background (especially if you come from a non-traditional background) into a compelling an unavoidable wave of capability and drive.

* [How to Explain Your Career Transition by Dorie Clark](http://dorieclark.com/how-to-explain-your-career-transition/)

### Build a Portfolio

All along the way, you should keep building things.  The work you've done will be crucial to demonstrating your technical skill and getting hired.  Employers want to see that you can build and ship code and that you make good decisions when confronted with engineering trade-offs.  All of this stems from conversations about your portfolio of work.

The portfolio is also important for another thing that isn't mentioned much -- social proof.  If you've been a part of larger or group projects, that's almost like showing that you've worked somewhere before.  It make the employer comfortable that other people have worked with you before so they can too.

Your portfolio as a developer is Github.  You may have a personal website but Github is still the authoritative repository of your technical ability.  Ignore it at your peril.

* [A Programmer's Portfolio by Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/10/a-programmers-portfolio.html)

* [Your Github Portfolio by Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/10/20/software-engineers-are-in-demand-and-github-is-how-you-find-them/)

### Clean up your Web Presence (and Have One)

Google yourself in an incognito window (to avoid Google's smart algorithm).  What comes up? Do the links fit into your personal narrative?  Whoever is looking to hire you will certainly Google you.  Make sure that what they find matches what you want them to find.  If you've got a ridiculously common name, you may have a harder time building your web presence but it's also harder to have the *wrong* web presence.

The most important part of your web presence to fix up is your Github profile.  Make sure your projects are organized and their README files contain a description and a link to where it is live so anyone looking at the project can quickly see your brilliance.

Next, try to be discoverable.  If I'm trying to get in touch with you or find your work on the web, can I?  Do you have a personal website?  Are you on Twitter? You don't need to go crazy with social media, but sometimes just having enough of a profile to be a "real" person and give people the opportunity to get in touch with you can go a long way.  

Use LinkedIn if you're not allergic to it.  Again, this is about getting your personal narrative out there in the way YOU choose and not relying on Google to get it right.  LinkedIn is fast replacing the resume anyway.  

Other sites, like Brand Yourself below, will describe a bit better how to take on your web presence, but just make sure your narrative is being told the way you want it to.

* [How Important Is It for a Programmer to Have an Online Presence? on Stack Exchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/143673/how-important-is-it-for-a-programmer-to-have-an-online-presence)

### Project: Build your Personal Website

You don't need a personal website right off the bat but it's good to have and it's a fun project to test your skills with.  In the simplest case, it's a direct conduit to you for anyone searching and another way to craft your narrative.  It doesn't have to be elaborate at all.  If you hate writing, don't blog.  But you need to be a real person.  Showcase your work.  Geek out.

* [Why Every Job Seeker Should Have a Personal Website](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/26/why-every-job-seeker-should-have-a-personal-website-and-what-it-should-include/)

### Get Out in the Community and Collect Information

Find and meet other developers.  That doesn't mean "power networking" but it does mean genuine human connection.  Your network of people DOES matter in a BIG way.  For now, it's probably just for answering questions and harvesting advice but your next job will probably be found through the people you know and some who you meet while you're gathering this advice.  People like giving advice and like investing themselves emotionally in other people with growth curves.

That's best to do in person 1-on-1, where you can ask your dumb questions, but there are plenty of communities as well, e.g. Meetups, Stack Overflow, Quora, local user groups...  Be a part of them and don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's a great way to build relationships.

You'll probably have a million questions but the relevant ones here are about understanding what exactly different jobs *are* and what they're looking for. The easiest way to find out is ask developers what they do.  It's much faster than trolling through blog posts trying to figure out the process.  Buy lunches and coffees if you must.  Set a goal of talking to 5 real human beings about your job search.

Another way to get this information is to check out a whole bunch of job postings.  You'll quickly start seeing similarities between them.  Yeah, it's shit work, but it must be done.  

Another facet of this is related to your web presence -- don't be afraid to produce content like blogging or answering questions on Quora.  They don't need to be explicitly technical, but should showcase your ability to think critically and write well.  Both of these play well with future employers.  

* [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://erudition.mohit.tripod.com/_Influence_People.pdf) is an essential classic that relates to business and networking but is applicable to all facets of the social world around you.  It's a must-read for everyone (and it's an easy read).

## Collect Leads 

You've moved beyond the preparation and knowledge gathering phase.  Now it's time to hit the pavement and approach the actual jobs.  

Organization is key here and a spreadsheet is highly recommended.  Keep track of not just the jobs themselves, but also their websites, any connections you have to the company, and a log of your activity.  Have a separate column for each "Must Have" criteria you identified in the earlier section (use a binary `true`/`false`) and each of the top 5 "Nice To Have" criteria (use a 3- or 5-point system) so you can quickly check off where the jobs rank.

Put any job opening you find into your spreadsheet.

### The Best Places to Look

Start with your network, even if it's small.  Reach out to your Facebook friends and friends-of-friends to see if anyone's hiring.  You should start your search with the highest probability / highest quality sources first:

1. Your network (including people you've met in the community)
2. Direct postings that go to a human (like when developers [not recruiters] send emails about job opening at their company to the local Ruby list).  It's important to have another human being on the other end of the emails.
2. Direct postings (like on a company website for a specific position).  These will also usually go to a specific human being.
3. Job boards (pretty much awful, you're in the herd now)

Try checking out these links for job boards.  The more technically-focused, the better:

* [Dice.com](http://www.dice.com)

### On Recruiters

There are a lot of recruiters out there whose job it is to get you hired, but you'll need to be careful about how you work with them.  For starters, they get paid based on a percentage of the salary you take, so their incentive is to get you paid as much as possible (which is good).  Unfortunately as a junior developer your salary is much lower than a senior engineer so you will not be their priority and they won't spend much time on you (which is bad).  

If you're approached out of the cold as a junior developer by a recruiter, chances are that they won't be going out of their way to learn your story and find you the right fit -- you're more likely to get put in the pile of resumes they send out to everyone. You probably don't yet have work experience that is salable enough for them to go out of their way to find you the right position.  In that case, you may find them sending out your resume to everyone just in hopes that they get their 20-30%.  Remember -- if they approached you in a spammy way (e.g. through LinkedIn), they probably do the same to companies so it's doubtful they'll add value to you.  

As you become more senior and your work is more unique, recruiters can add a lot of value to your career by understanding the potential market for you and opening doors you may not otherwise have found (so don't get down on them yet!).  As a junior, you're unfortunately more of a commodity, so you probably won't find value in working with recruiters yet.  Rely on your own ability to hustle and sell yourself.


## Qualify Leads

You should have the criteria that you use to evaluate a job already figured out and it should already be in your spreadsheet.  Look through each lead on your spreadsheet and cross off the ones that fail your "must-have" criteria, then rank them based on your "nice-to-have" criteria.  You should be able to easily come up with a weighting system that lets you sort the jobs in order of preference.  Simpler is better, so no need to go overboard.

Next, make a column for the percentage likelihood of getting the job with a reasonable effort.  Multiply this with the value of the job based on the previous step, sort by this new "expected value", and you should have an indication of which jobs are most worth your time.

Part of the reason for qualifying the leads is to make sure you don't get sucked into a process and waste a bunch of time applying to jobs that you wouldn't actually take anyway.  That's surprisingly easy.  You'll still be able to send out "practice" applications, but at least now you know which companies are worth sending those out to.

Some other criteria to think about in the "nice-to-have" column:

* How easily can I continue to learn at that job?
* Is there access to mentors and teaching?
* How good are my peers who I can learn from?
* How much would I like going into work each day?
* What are the job-security risks of the job? Corporations aren't lock-tight just because they're big... they go through restructuring phases and lay off people with little good reason.
* Does it pay well enough to support me?
* Does its location fit the needs of me and my family?
* How long do I want this (first) job for?


## Project: Build your Resume

The goal of a resume is to get them interested enough to start a conversation.  From there, it's on you to speak intelligently about the things you've done. So don't treat the resume as the catch-all repository of your whole life -- it's more of a focused marketing tool designed to make you seem worth taking another look at.

A developer's resume is an interesting thing because so much of your value is demonstrated from your projects, which live in your Github (and are hopefully also deployed somewhere online).  Despite this focus on projects, you can't ignore previous work experience or education.  They are both important for showing the social proof that other people have worked with you before and you've met their standards for applying.  

It's difficult to come up with (or find on the internet) a standard resume type for a junior developer.  Most of the ones out there aren't particularly inspiring.  The keys to remember are the perspective of the hiring manager we talked about before -- that person wants to hire a developer who is highly capable and can get shit done (and will add value ASAP).  

The hiring manager will determine these criteria in less than 10 seconds at first glance based on where you've been educated, who's hired you before, and if you've got any really interesting projects that stand out.  The hiring manager rapidly builds a story of who you are based on those headline items of your resume.  If you're lucky, that high level story will seem interesting enough for the hiring manager or HR person to look twice and actually read what you did at each job and then bring you in for an interview.

Knowing that perspective, how can you play to it?  It's difficult if you're breaking into a new industry so you'll need to emphasize relevant education, work experience and projects in a way that crafts a story of drive and capability.  What have you done that shows you're highly capable (e.g. your technical chops, any recognition you've received, leadership of teams)? And can get shit done (e.g. interesting projects, open source contributions)?

Remember: ONE PAGE.

* [Formatting could use some work, but here's an example resume from CareerCup.com](http://www.careercup.com/resume)

## Reaching Out and Applying

The next step is to actually apply.  Don't send all your applications out at once! You'll get totally overwhelmed if you start hearing back from people and need to complete tasks all at once.  Treat it like an iterative process where you'll send out several applications each day, learn from any mistakes you can identify based on feedback from the process, and try again the next day.  

Note: This is NOT an excuse to procrastinate or only send out one application a day.  You should have a definite goal for number of applications per day.  3? 5? 10?

Over time, you will work your way through your excel list.  It's usually good to start at the bottom with the companies that you would barely work at.  Once you feel comfortable with your application-sending and hopefully interviewing abilities, you can start tackling the companies at the top that you *really* want to work for.

### Go in the Side Door

Where do you start?  Do two things at once -- send applications to a few companies towards the bottom of your list to practice but also look at the top companies on your list and build a strategy.  Remember, the best way to get in is to NOT use their online resume drop but to instead identify a real human being at the company and connect with that person somehow.  Even better is to be so publicly brilliant that they come to you but... we can't have it all.

So there are probably a few companies that you'd *really* like to work for.  You'll want to spend a lot more time on them than you would for the ones at the bottom (which are hopefully good for interview practice).  Not only should you try to find a real human being at the company, but you can also potentially get noticed by tailoring your project work to them.  You'll be building projects (I hope) to stay in practice anyway, so make one of those a clone of the top company's website with a new feature you'd like to see, then use that to display your interest.  

Get to know the company and its needs and see if you can reach out to address them somehow.  Do they have local events you can visit?  What do they sponsor? This stuff takes creativity.  You need to walk the line where you're not a stalker but you do care enough to push hard.  If you're wrong, they may say no.  It happens, you'll live and move on.  But you'd better try!  You'll probably figure things out that will help you with other companies anyway.

* [Getting noticed by a startup you want to work for](http://www.thedailymuse.com/job-search/want-to-work-for-a-start-up-heres-how-to-get-noticed/)

### Perseverance Through the Process

One of the key parts of the process, though, is keeping your spirits up.  It SUCKS looking for jobs full time.  You can go weeks without hearing a peep from anyone.  Then you'll have a day where you get an interview and your spirits will soar and then you won't pass and you'll feel like crap again.  Then you'll get another three interviews in one day and it'll be crazy for a time before another long waiting period.  The inconsistency of it is maddening, so do what you need to in your own life to make sure you don't let it get you down.

It's also really important to not act/sound desperate, even though you probably are.  No one wants to hire someone who is desperate because it violates so much of the social proof that people use to figure out if you're a good candidate -- if no one else will hire you and you're so desperate, it makes them wonder what's wrong with you.  And, frankly, there's nothing wrong... everyone goes through a grueling process when they start looking for jobs.  Just don't let it get to you (or at least don't make it sound like it's gotten to you).  

The point here is really just to make sure you understand that it's a really annoying/painful/long process for everyone and you're not alone!

### Resume Versions

If you're applying to several different types of positions, tailor your resume for the specific type of opportunity.  Just remember that, if you're submitting it virtually, they can see the title.

### Cover Letters

Some positions require you to also submit cover letters.  In my own experience, I've rarely actually seen the cover letter that an applicant has submitted for a job posting.  They have a magical way of getting lost or ignored.  If someone's spending < 10 seconds looking at your resume at first, why are they going to read a long cover letter?  

Though they may not look at your cover letter during the first pass, if your resume looks interesting then the cover letter has a way of becoming more important.  The hiring manager wants to make sure the story he crafted in his head is even more awesome in reality when hearing it from the applicant's own words.  So it's important to not to use meaningless buzz words and platitudes in your cover letter but instead focus on providing a concise but descriptive (and specific) letter answering the key questions we've talked about before (are you capable and driven?).

It also needs to answer a new question that the resume doesn't really address directly: "Why does this person actually want to work at MY company?".  That's actually very important if it's a startup or other strongly cultural organization -- they're looking for people who have a very strong reason for wanting to work there so they know you'll stick around and grow with the company.

#### Email Cover Letters

Every piece of communication you have with a company is relevant.  The most important is the one where you first reach out via email.  You probably want to treat that as a condensed version of a cover letter -- express your brilliance and fit in just a few powerful sentences.


### Applying

Track every application you send out in your spreadsheet by the date you sent it.  As we said above, you don't need to go crazy on Day 1 but keep a regular flow of applications going out.

### Following up

Follow up on all applications you care about.  Follow up once in the first few days and again after a week or two if you haven't heard anything.  This obviously works best if you've identified an individual at the company before, but the point is that perseverance matters and it can help you display the kind of drive you're trying to show in your resume anyway.

This actually applies to the whole process, not just applications.  Follow up your interviews (with a thank you to your interviewer on day 1 too).  Follow up your tech screens.  The goal here isn't to be naggy and annoying/desperate, and it's certainly not to be a robot sending auto-generated emails all the time.  Just be human and honest and simple in your language.


## Interviewing and Preparing to Interview

Interviewing is right up there with public speaking in the hierarchy of fears for most people.  Not only are you performing for someone else but they're actively judging you the whole time... yikes!  

Far be it from us to try and get you over that psychological hurdle but it's definitely best if you can actually treat the interviews as a chance to show off the cool stuff you've built and the interesting new skills you've learned.  The best interviews are enthusiastic conversations with technical depth.

The first step before everything is to prepare.  You'll want to figure out the questions you might expect to be asked (and the general responses you'll have for each which demonstrate your brilliance) and you'll want to research the company too.  Your knowledge of the company will help you tailor your pitch to their needs and also allow you to ask intelligent questions about their product and technology when the time comes.  Again, refer to the [Happy Bear article](http://happybearsoftware.com/how-to-get-a-programmer-job.html) for some great tips.

### How the process works once you're in the funnel

Just a quick overview of the process a typical tech company will go through when hiring developers:

1. Phone Screen
2. Technical Interview
3. Technical Challenge
4. Fit Interviews
5. Job Offer
6. Offer Negotiation
7. Offer Acceptance

### The Phone Screen

Congratulations! Your resume wasn't a total train-wreck and they've invited you for a phone screen (note -- sometimes you actually do the tech challenge first).  The real purpose of this screen, which is often roughly a half hour with someone from Human Resources (not the actual hiring manager), is to make sure you've got a good chance of passing their technical interview and fit interviews.  So consider it a light version of each of these.  

You'll probably be asked about some of the technical things you've listed on your resume but not actually dive into the depths (though some places do a brain teaser too) and you'll probably be asked some more "softer" questions about why you chose the job and what you've done before.  Companies vary widely in how they use the phone screen.  The basic tactic here isn't a tactic -- be honest and enthusiastic and open.  And don't be afraid to practice talking about yourself in front of the mirror.  

FINAL NOTE -- this is not one-size-fits-all and many companies skip the light stuff and dive right into a technical screen so you've got to be prepared just in case!  The Coding Horror link below is more descriptive about that case.

### The Tech Interview

The technical interview is usually the most terrifying part of the interview process. It's where they will assess whether you've got the technical chops to make it.  That means you'll not only be asked very specifically about the work you've done, but also to solve logic problems or code live or whiteboard some new features.  

In fact, one point of the interview is often to push you to your limit just to see how you react to not knowing something.  If you do an exercise too easily, they'll go to a much harder one.  Especially as a beginner, you will hit a lot of stumbling points.  The biggest asset you have is honesty and intellectual curiosity.  

When solving a problem, make sure to do so in a clear and logical way, explaining out loud why you're doing each step.  Talk through your roadblocks and give examples of how you'd find the solution in the "real world".  Often, that answer would be to Google for some particular function.  Say so!  They know you're not a Ruby expert, but they need to know that you'll be able to seek out solutions to the problems you'll inevitably encounter on the job.  

It's also totally okay to use a brute force (inefficient) solution to a coding problem. That's often the best place to start, just so you can be sure you've got the right feel for the problem.  You'll usually be asked how you can make the solution better, but that's much better than trying for a brilliant solution and running out of time with no work to show for it.  Again, your job isn't to be brilliant as much as to be adaptable and thoughtful in the face of challenges.  

And if you don't know something, it's better to say so and work with your interviewer to figure it out.  Trust me, they want you to succeed as much as you do because there's nothing tougher as an interviewer than seeing someone silently crashing on a problem and getting more and more frustrated but not asking for help or providing any window into their thoughts.  

You'll need to read up on a variety of things that weren't focused on in the previous few courses, including data structures and algorithms, just because they're favorite targets of interviewers.  They may not be great indicators of coding skill, but the world is stuck in its ways and you'll be asked those more "Computer Science-y" questions.

### The tech challenge

The take-home tech challenge may occur before or after the in-person screen, depending on the company.  They will give you an application or problem which will take up to a full day to complete on your own time.  Examples of take-home tech challenges include building out a sample web app with tests or solving a challenging algorithmic problem using code.  

They'll evaluate you on the completeness of your solution and the quality of your code.  If it occurred before the technical interview, it's a good mechanism for them to test your commitment (up to half of people never even turn in a solution).

### The Final Step: "Fit"

The final step before the final decision is usually to meet the whole team and get put through the paces at their offices over the period of several hours.  They'll probably test you technically but the goal is also to make sure you'd be a good person to work with.  If any one member of the team doesn't think you'd be a good fit, you usually won't be hired.  Advice?  Don't be weird or awkward even if you are at home :)

It's also a chance for you to test them out.  If you've gotten this far in the process, there's a reasonable likelihood that you've got a good match.  You'll need to figure out if this is the kind of company you want to work for so bring a list of questions and make sure they get answered.

### A Note on Compensation

Do. Not. Provide. Compensation. Expectations.

Companies will always ask you "how much do you expect to get paid".  Your answer?  "I expect to get paid a fair market rate" (unless you're a bit cocky and decide you should get paid above market.  See how that goes.).  There's nothing you can possibly gain from providing an expectation for comp.  If it's lower than what they would have offered you, you just capped what they'll offer you.  If it's higher, they may just scuttle the process because you're too expensive.  

Once you have an offer, you can check it against fair market rate by asking other people (hopefully you've got some people by now who you might ask) or going to [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com) (just remember you're junior so won't get "average").  But the real point is to not shoot yourself in the foot when they ask.

## Handling an Offer

If you kicked butt, you'll get an offer.  That means there's a pretty good chance you'll get to work there, but just remember that not all "offers" (especially verbal-only ones) are actually real.  It's a good time to be happy because you did well but don't expect that it's a done deal.  I've seen companies pull offers for internal reasons or external reasons -- the point is that it happens, so don't go buying a house until you've signed the documents.  If it's just a verbal offer, ask them to email you the details.

DO NOT ACCEPT RIGHT AWAY! This is doubly true if you don't think it's a good offer.  This is an important point for you -- they've been totally in control of the process until now and they've probably dragged their feet because they can (who knows, an even better developer might show up, right?).  Now it's your turn.  They've put in a lot of effort so far and any reasonable company isn't going to let you walk away over a few days or a few thousand dollars.  They should give you at least a week to decide.

One big factor is compensation.  The person making the offer usually has discretion to bump it up a bit (maybe $5k in Silicon Valley, probably less elsewhere) without asking their manager, so it's often a good idea to negotiate the first offer.  Maybe you're negotiating salary, vacation, relocation bonuses, or personal project status.  It doesn't matter, your position is a whole lot better while you're holding that offer.

What's the best thing you can do?  GET ANOTHER OFFER!  There's nothing nearly as good when negotiating as another offer from another company which gives you the ability to walk away.  You shouldn't be shamelessly callous and capitalistic about it (the goal isn't to piss off everyone who gave you offers), but do take advantage of this! 

Not only that, but remember all those companies that dragged their feet and you hadn't heard back from?  Send every one of them (who you are realistically interested in) an email explaining that you have an offer and need to make a decision relatively quickly.  See if that doesn't help them speed you along in the process and maybe get you that other offer.  As soon as you have an offer to work with, you suddenly have all that social proof you never had before since you haven't worked anywhere else.  Use it.  

Once you've worked through your negotiation and hopefully had the chance to rank multiple offers, the decision must be made.  That's a good choice to have to make.  Congratulations!  Now you get paid to keep learning.

## Alternate Paths

We've covered a whole lot about job search, evaluation, and acquisition.  Do you not feel ready for work just yet?  Odds are that you are, so don't fool yourself into not trying just because it's difficult.  But... Maybe you just skipped to this course and ignored the other ones.  There are a few alternate paths towards employment which you may consider.

### Bootcamps

_Perfect is the enemy of good - Voltaire._

You may be considering attending a full-time coding bootcamp because they tend to provide their own pipelines to finding jobs. The majority of people shelling out money to attend full-time coding bootcamps seek to enhance their career prospects. Yes, there is a component of genuine interest and learning, but a clear expectation is that the programming courses offer an entry into a programming career. Some companies advertise 100% placement rate and six figure offers. How credible are these claims? Are such points relevant for your overall career search process?

If you're looking to be better informed about a full-time coding bootcamp and whether it might be useful to you, read this guide to help make your decision: [Choosing a Full-Time Coding Bootcamp](leanpub.com/choosing-programming-course)

It's important to be well informed, so don't skimp on the research before applying.  When I did admissions at [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io), a surprisingly large number of applicants had never even researched other bootcamps, which was astonishing.  That said, I can say that I had a great experience going through the App Academy program and will wholeheartedly admit my bias towards it.  They require no tuition until you've found a dev job, which is a pretty good risk/reward situation.  [If you use this link to apply, they've offered to help support The Odin Project!](http://www.appacademy.io/?referer=The+Odin+Project)  You should always make an informed decision, but that's our bias :)

### Contributing to The Odin Project and Other Open Source

We've talked a lot about how important it is to have a good portfolio of work and experience.  We've also talked about how helpful open source contributions are for this purpose.  Luckily for you, there's a growing movement to make open source projects more accessible for beginners and it starts with The Odin Project!  We run a team of volunteer developers using agile methodologies to work on this very website (which is open source).  [See our Getting Involved page for more information](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/blob/admin-flash/getting_involved.md).

Sam Joseph of HPU has also been facilitating a listing of other beginner-friendly open source projects, particularly for non-profits.  You should be able to find other interesting projects to work on there.  More information about that project can be found at [AgileVentures.org](http://agileventures.org).

### Volunteering

There are always more projects than developers.  Related to the open source side of things, you can often volunteer your time to make websites for friends, former colleagues, and organizations.  It's always better to get paid (even if it's a token amount), but do what you have to do so you can get more projects under your belt and more evidence that you're hireable as a developer.  Good luck!

## Conclusion

I hope you're reading this from your new office.  If you got a job after doing the Odin Project, [drop us a line!](/contact) We'd love to hear how everything went.  The whole reason for putting this project out there is to try and onboard more people into the web development profession and tech in general.  Hopefully your success will inspire even more people to give it a shot.

So build some kick ass software, learn as much as you can, and pay it forward when you're able.  Thanks for participating in the project!!!
