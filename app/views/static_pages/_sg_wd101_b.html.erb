  <h3>Web Development 101</h3>

  <p>This is a free weekly study group on Sundays at 6pm CDT (GMT-5). We will be working through The Odin Project <%= link_to "curriculum", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses" %> from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>During the week, we will be working through the curriculum 
  independently, and completed projects are due on Sunday at our meeting. During our study group meetings, we can show our completed projects, discuss questions, and keep each other motivated.</p>

  <p>I'm a beginner. But if you have more experience please feel free to join up. We are going to try and follow the same schedule as the previous Web development 101. I decided to start a study group so I can keep myself on schedule and for those have just started and feel to far behind to jump in the other groups.</p>
  <p> Note: There are now two times for the study group on Sundays. In the calender, I did try to make it so we can all edit and take a look. That way we can just add a hangout if you need help and someone can jump on and helpout. </p>

  <h4>What We'll Cover</h4>
  <p>
    It's a tough week this week so I hope you've gotten a head start -- we'll be doing all the lessons up to the Jumpstart Blogger tutorial in Ruby on Rails. For some, it may be your first taste of Rails.  It'll be challenging at first because I'm intentionally throwing a lot at you.  We can debug your issues in the study group.

  <h4>What We'll Cover</h4>
  <p>
    March 17 - March 23, 2014
  </p>
  <p>
    Because we didn't have a real meeting last week, consider this a reprieve and some extra time to work on Ruby!  The homework assignment is still chapters 1 - 10 in Chris Pine's book but you can hopefully also dive into the Ruby Monk lessons listed in the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-basics">Ruby Basics</a> lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Sunday we will review any questions you have about Chris Pine's book, the Ruby Monk tutorials, and look ahead to the Test-first project which will be done the following week.
