### Community Rules

Our Discord server is a very active community of people from all over the world and is moderated by a team of volunteers. When you join Discord, you'll see that our moderation team has 3 different [roles](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/blob/main/about/discord-roles.md): Core, Maintainer, and Moderator.

Our moderation team is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, personal appearance, body, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

We expect everyone to handle themselves in a professional manner and follow the spirit of our community rules. If you are given a warning by a member of our moderation team, please do not take it personally or be argumentative. We truly want to help you learn how to interact with others professionally, but your second chance does not have priority over the well-being of our community.

#### 1. Please leave moderation to the moderators

Please DM the @ModMail user with issues that need to be resolved with things on the server, like someone being a troll, or breaking rules in a way that requires intervention. Don't be afraid to let us know if something isn't right.

#### 2. This community only supports the content in our curriculum

All questions and advice should stay within the scope of our curriculum because we are only equipped to support our own material and recommendations. Therefore, we do not support homework or personal projects, even if the topic is covered by our curriculum. You should instead ask your teacher, a classmate, or another resource for help.

If you seek support on relationships, depression, mental illness, or anything else outside the scope of our curriculum, please seek out more equipped and professional resources.

#### 3. This community does not support Windows/WSL

Our maintainer team has chosen to not recommend or support Windows/WSL for [multiple reasons](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/blog/wiki/Why-We-Do-Not-Support-Windows). If you have chosen to ignore this prerequisite, it is your responsibility to research instructions and seek help outside of this community.

#### 4. Do not short-circuit a teaching moment

If somebody is already getting help, do not jump in the middle of the conversation. We know you mean well, but it is counter-productive and overwhelming for the person receiving help to follow multiple conversations. For more information on how we encourage guiding a person to their own answer, please read [How to Help Others Solve Coding Problems](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/blog/wiki/How-to-Help-Others-Solve-Coding-Problems).

#### 5. Do not send anyone an unsolicited ping, DM, or friend request

Everyone in this community is a volunteer and shares the responsibility to answer questions. It is unfair to expect specific people to answer your question. If you are being privately harassed by a community member, please DM the @ModMail user to report the situation.

#### 6. Any form of harassment is not tolerated

Do not post NSFL/NSFW content or sexual remarks. In addition, any racist remarks, religious persecution, doxing, trolling, spamming, flaming, baiting or any other attention-stealing behavior will result in an immediate ban.

#### 7. Any form of illegal activity is not tolerated

Posting about any illegal activities, including piracy, links to pirated material, or suggesting someone pirate intellectual property will result in an immediate ban.

#### 8. No political or religious topics

This is a diverse community; there are people from many different ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds. Do not post any topic that could be perceived as political or religious because it can be divisive and hinder our ability to support each other.

#### 9. Ask detailed and specific questions

We encourage questions, so do not worry about asking a "stupid question". However, it is important that you [Help Yourself Before Asking Others](/before_asking) and follow our tips on [How to Ask a Technical Question](/how_to_ask). In addition, to ensure that everyone has the same expectations, below are some specific guidelines on asking questions:

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

-   **Ask questions in the proper channel.** We have specific channels for every section in our curriculum, so please find the best one to ask your question. While asking questions regarding The Odin Project or our curriculum is allowed in our #odin-general channel, you should seek a more appropriate channel if there is already an active conversation.

-   **Post your question in one and only one channel.** Cross posting will not get you an answer sooner, and it will split the discussion into redundant and/or conflicting answers.

-   **Stay online after asking a question.** Most of the time, answers are not simple and straight-forward. Therefore, you should be prepared to stick around and discuss it with those trying to help.

-   **Wait patiently for a response.** Even though our community is fairly active, not all questions will be answered right away. While you are waiting, make sure that you have provided a detailed question and continue trouble-shooting. If your post is getting buried and/or if you have been waiting for an hour, you can direct people to your question.

-   **Do not ask to ask a question.** You have permission to ask questions, provided that it falls within our rules. We know you mean well, but it is somewhat inconsiderate to make people wait for your actual question. For more information, please read [Don't ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/).

-   **Use external services to share code.** Posting small snippets of code is acceptable, but anything longer than a few lines is hard to read and parse. Use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to share longer snippets of code, and [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) to share long error messages.

-   **Use screenshots to share other relevant information.** When you need to share an image of your terminal window or an error message, use a screenshot tool on your computer. If you are not familiar with this tool, you should research it using your favorite search engine. You should never take a photo of your screen with your phone, as that will provide a lower quality image that can be difficult for others to actually read.

-   **Do not share files that require a user to download it.** It is impossible to tell whether a file contains malware or has some other malicious intent, so you should never share a file that requires users to download and open it on their own device.

#### 10. Be professional and have good etiquette

We expect everyone to handle themselves professionally and treat others respectfully, no matter how old you are or how much experience you have. To ensure that everyone has the same expectations, below are some specific guidelines:

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

-   **Do not post personal information.** This applies to all sensitive information, as well as **your age** (unless you are an adult).

-   **No sexual or offensive usernames, nicknames, or profile pictures.** This detracts from a professional, friendly, safe and welcoming environment. Depending on the context, this may result in either a moderator changing your nickname or requesting you to change your profile picture, or an immediate ban.

-   **Do not compare time with others.** When people try to compare how much time it takes even to do TOP or even just one project, it tends to lead to feelings of inadequacy or a false sense of accomplishment. Everyone has different life circumstances and project completion expectations, so we discourage comparing time and instead focus on learning the material well.

-   **Only ping another user when necessary.** It is often not necessary to ping a specific person because everyone shares the responsibility to help others. If you choose to ping another user about a recent conversation, please wait patiently for a reply.

-   **Do not bomb the chat by sending multiple messages in a row.** Please type your entire comment or question in one message. To create a new line, use `shift + enter/return` on your computer or the `enter/return` button on your mobile device.

-   **Provide context when sharing a resource.** When posting a link to an article or youtube video, include **why** you are sharing it. Otherwise it will be marked as spam and deleted.

-   **Post your finished projects in #creations-showcase.** This channel is a great collection of finished projects. Feedback happens in the #creations-discussions channel. Everyone is welcome to provide feedback on a project that you have completed.

-   **Respect that people will have differences of opinion.** Every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer.

-   **Be constructive, not destructive.** When providing feedback to another user, make sure you provide constructive feedback rather than feedback that is negative for the sake of being negative. Telling someone that their project is terrible or that they don't know how to write code doesn't provide them any actual help.

-   **Remember the Human.** Behind every username there is a person with feelings, so be kind to everyone! If you wouldn't say it out loud, or wouldn't want someone else saying it to you, don't post it.

-   **Be gracious during misunderstandings.** When misunderstandings happen, choose to be gracious instead of argumentative. Give others the benefit of the doubt during text-based communication because you can not take into account body language, cultural differences, or other contextual cues.

Our moderation team enforces these rules to keep our community a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone. If anyone repeatedly breaks rules, responds with negative/toxic attitudes, pushes the boundaries of our rules, or shows “[help vampire](https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/)” behavior, they will be banned.

If you are notified about your behavior by a moderator, we encourage you to be open and willing to change. Our rules are very similar to the expectations in professional workplaces, so this will better prepare you to interact professionally with your future teammates.
