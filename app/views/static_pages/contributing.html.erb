      <h1>How to Contribute</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>The Odin Project</strong>
        is crowdsourced. It is built both by experienced engineers and by people who are currently learning to code
        <em>just like you</em>. Regardless of your experience, you can contribute... in fact, we hope you do! Even if you don't feel ready, you can still get involved and observe until you're comfortable.
      </p>

      <p>There are two main ways you can contribute:</p>

      <h3>1) Contribute to the Curriculum</h3>
      <p>Anyone with any experience level can contribute to the curriculum.  Students in particular are encouraged to do this, especially if you are just starting out!</p>
      <p>Contributing to the curriculum involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding your own solutions to lessons.</li>
        <li>Updating individual lessons with resources.</li>
        <li>Writing new lessons or updating any that are unfinished.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More information about the curriculum can be found <a href="https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>2) Contribute to the Main Site</h3>
      <p>
        The Odin Project is (chiefly) a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> application.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with any Open Source project, there is a constant backlog of outstanding issues and new features that we would love help with. We have a <a href="https://trello.com/b/Wx1WMToy/main-site-development">Trello Board</a> where we organise the backlog.  Anyone is welcome to join in and start working on any one of these tickets - the more the merrier!
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructions on setting up your local development environment can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject">GitHub repo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>NOTE: When choosing an issue to work on, please check out the <strong>#contributing</strong> channel on <a href="https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/Contributing">our Gitter chat</a>, and let everyone know what you are working on.  This is important, as somebody else may have already done some work on the issue - in which case they would probably love to have your help!</em>
      </p>
