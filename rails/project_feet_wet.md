# Project: Getting Your Feet Wet With Rails
*Estimated Time: 3-4 hrs*

*Don't forget to use Git to save your projects!*

## Warmup: Installations and Blogger

To do this course, you've got to have Rails and several other technologies [properly installed on your computer](/web-development-101/installations).  That will be the first task if you haven't already.

Next comes the [Jumpstart Lab Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) (which was assigned way back in the Web Development 101 course).  The Blogger tutorial is actually more challenging than the project below, and was assigned to give you a chance to get in over your head a bit so you'd pay attention along the way :)

### Your Task

1. If you haven't already, do the [Installations project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/installations).  If you've already got Rails on your system, it's still worth skipping to the bottom and verifying that you've got **Rails 4** and **Ruby 2** working properly.  The section says:

    Even if you didn't use the Railsbridge installation instructions, verify your installation by following their instructions for [creating and deploying a sample Rails app](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/deploying_to_heroku). 

2. If you haven't already, do the [Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).
3. If you hadn't done either of these, you should go back to the [Web Development 101](/web-development-101) course and at least do the [Web Development Frameworks section](/web-development-101/#section-web-development-frameworks).

## Project: Starting The RoR Tutorial

We will be using the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl throughout this course.  It is a complete, step-by-step walkthrough of building and testing a Twitter-like microblogging application.  It covers a lot of material but so does this course, so we'll be spacing out the chapters along the way to go with the appropriate lesson material.  

Though this tutorial is a major common theme across all the coming lessons and serves to tie them together into one major project, we'll also be building plenty of independent projects along the way.  

In this chapter, you'll build a simple scaffolded app on Rails.  It won't be as complicated as the Blogger Tutorial was and is really just to make sure your system is all set up and your brain is switched into Rails mode.

### Your Task

1. Read and follow along with [Chapter 2 of The Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.org/book/demo_app#cha-a_demo_app) by Michael Hartl, where you will create a basic Ruby on Rails application.

### Student Solutions

*Send us your solution so we can show others! Submit a link to the Github repo with your files in it here using any of the methods listed on the [contributing page](http://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/contributing.md).  

*If you will be submitting a solution for the RoR tutorial chapter 2, make sure it's in a repo that you won't overwrite when we move onto chapter 3 (which starts a new app)*
