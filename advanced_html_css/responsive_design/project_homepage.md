### Introduction

For your final HTML/CSS project, you're going to create a responsive homepage, something you might find on a portfolio site of sorts. When you get to the point that you want to start sharing your work, or applying for jobs, it's useful to have a well-designed portfolio to share so take this as an opportunity to practice the more advanced HTML and CSS concepts you have learnt!

Similarly to landing page and admin dashboard from previous projects, you are tasked to build a given design brief. We're providing a full design in 3 different sizes, full desktop, tablet and mobile, and this is the first real project where you should take your time and make sure that it looks acceptable at *any* screen size.

Feel free to pick your own fonts and colors and use something other than a stock-photo for your header. The main focus is on achieving the specified layouts and responsive behaviour rather than a complete portfolio.

Many of the most liked submissions will have come from when this project used to be a bit more personal, and some people used it as an opportunity to make their own portfolio website. Many of these likely will have been updated over time and so no longer reflect the current state and goal of this project.

### Assignment

#### Step 1: Set up and planning

1. Set up your HTML and CSS files with some dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
1. Download a full-resolution copy of the design files ([desktop design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/1c8b5c739efd263e8cc48703988b18d6e3afe034/advanced_html_css/responsive-design/project_personal_portfolio/imgs/portfolio.png), [tablet design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/1c8b5c739efd263e8cc48703988b18d6e3afe034/advanced_html_css/responsive-design/project_personal_portfolio/imgs/portfolio%20tablet.png), [mobile design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/1c8b5c739efd263e8cc48703988b18d6e3afe034/advanced_html_css/responsive-design/project_personal_portfolio/imgs/portfolio%20mobile.png)), and get a general idea for how you're going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.

#### Step 2: Gather assets

1. The portraits we've used in the design files are stock photos downloaded from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/). If you don't have a picture of yourself handy, feel free to go grab a placeholder for now.
1. Select your fonts! We're using `Playfair Display` and `Roboto` in the design, both available with Google fonts.
1. In the design we have icon-links for GitHub, LinkedIn and X (formerly known as Twitter). Obviously feel free to add whatever links you want to your own site. We got those icons from [https://devicon.dev/](https://devicon.dev/).
1. Other icons (phone, email and external link) were downloaded as SVGs from [https://materialdesignicons.com/](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

#### Step 3: Some tips!

1. As you might expect, you can organize your work on this project however you please. We've given you many tips over the past several lessons, and you are likely already comfortable starting from a blank page.
1. If you like being told what to do: The author of this lesson feels most comfortable starting out with the larger sections of the layout, and then working from the top of the page to the bottom. In other words, get the various sections in more or less the right place (header, projects, contact etc.) while ignoring a lot of specific style and content details, then go back through from the top-to-bottom filling-in, styling and cleaning up everything.
1. It doesn't matter when or how you accomplish the responsiveness of this project. There are people who will tell you that you should always start with the mobile experience and then use media-queries to tell your layout how to expand. The 'mobile-first' crew *does* have some good points (Google it!) but in the end, how you accomplish it doesn't matter as long as it works. Good luck!
1. When you're done, don't forget to push it to GitHub, and use GitHub Pages to publish it to the world! You should be proud of what you've accomplished here!

#### Step 4: Give your feedback

1. Before you move on, we would love it if you could [send us your feedback on the Advanced HTML and CSS course](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVvT-2TiczhXP9qGfr28Aq6w6wzct0ypDqcpztaocA9bypXw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Getting user (you) feedback is important so we can continue to improve the curriculum and get an idea of your experience.
