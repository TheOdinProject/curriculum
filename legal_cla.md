# Contributor Licensing Agreement

*Last Modified 3/22/14*

This agreement will apply if you make contributions to the project (which we hope you will).

### Preamble

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, The Odin Project ("The Project") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been digitally agreed to by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of The Project; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your past, present and future Contributions submitted to The Project. Except for the license granted herein to The Project and recipients of software distributed by The Project, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

### Definitions

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with The Project. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship (including code), including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to The Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by The Project (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to The Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, The Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

### Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to The Project and to recipients of software distributed by The Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

### No Warranty

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### Representations and Warranties

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to The Project, or that your employer has executed a separate Agreement with The Project. 

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see below for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You must identify the complete details of its source and ensure that the original author is also bound by this agreement.

### No agency

No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.

### Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless The Project and each of Its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers and directors, agents, employees, and partners from any third party claim or demand, including reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees for damages and/or costs due to or arising out of Your breach of any license, agreements, commitments, representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement.

### Use of Contributions

The Project shall have no obligation to publish, disseminate, or make any other use of any Contribution.

### Severability

Should one or more provisions of these Terms of Use be found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision(s) shall be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and/or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect.

### Third Party Submissions and Links

The Project is not responsible for the content or actions of any third party websites or services associated with Your Contribution.  You agree to take sole legal responsibility for any links you Contribute, and this agreement does not apply to any content on other websites related to those links. You should consult the terms and privacy policies of those other websites to understand your rights.

### Changes

You agree to notify The Project of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

### Assignment

The Project may assign its rights and (where permissible by law) its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any third party at any time without notice, including without limitation, to any person or entity acquiring all or substantially all of the assets or business of The Project. You may not assign this Agreement or the rights and duties hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party without the prior written consent of The Project.
