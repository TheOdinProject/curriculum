# The Odin Project Curriculum Roadmap
This contains the development roadmap of the curriculum. The high level
goals and objectives we are currently striving to achieve with the curriculum
are kept here.

This is structured by stretch goals and projects

Stretch goals are the large, ambitious overall goals we are pursuing with the curriculum and
projects are smaller more manageable pieces of work that will move the curriculum towards the
overall goals.

## Current Stretch Goals

* Create Frontend and Backend curriculum tracks
* Refresh courses and make them sustainable by creating teams of maintainers for each course

## Current Projects

### Remove all Ruby and Rails lessons from the Web Development 101 course.
In order to allow the curriculum to be split into multiple tracks we need to remove
the dependency that many of the courses have on lessons that are in the Web Development
101 course.

Because the Ruby and Rails sections are at the end of Web Development 101 and the full
Ruby and Rails courses comes straight after Web Development 101 it makes sense to start
with by removing them.


#### Objectives
- [ ] Extract Database lessons from Web Development 101 and the Rails course into its own mini course. This new course will come right before the Rails course.
- [ ] Ship the new refreshed basics section in the Ruby course and remove the Backend section in Web development 101.
- [ ] Remove the Web Development Frameworks section in Web development 101 after the rails course is updated to cover anything that was taught in those lessons.
- [ ] Extract installation instructions for Ruby and Rails from the the Installations project to their respective courses.
