### Introduction
Knowing how to use the Developers Tools inside your browser is an important skill for any web developer. The Developer Tools are useful for running JavaScript code, editing HTML and CSS styles without having to refresh the page, or viewing performance data. They also save you lots of time. Getting started couldn't be any easier.

### Opening Dev Tools

1. From the Browser Menu:
    - Chrome: Select the `Chrome Menu` > `More Tools` > `Developer Tools`
    - Firefox: Select the Firefox `Menu` > `Web Developer`> `Toggle Tools`  
2. Right click anywhere on a webpage and select `Inspect`
3. Use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL + Shift + I` (`option + command + I` on Mac)
