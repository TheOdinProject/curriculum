# Project: Rails
<!-- *Estimated Time: 6-8 hrs* -->

In this project, you'll get the opportunity to actually build a real rails application.  It's not a trivially simple one either -- it's got a lot of wrinkles and things that you're not going to understand.

To be honest, you're kind of going into the deep end so don't worry if you don't understand what exactly you're doing in all the steps.  The point here is to get familiar with the process of creating a Rails app, what things generally look like, and what you don't know.  When you get to the end of this project, you can consider yourself remarkably persistent and resilient.

Because you'll be doing so much stuff that we haven't taught you yet, this is a good project to find a partner to work with on even though it's just following a tutorial.

1. Follow the instructions atop the [Google Homepage project](/web-development-101/html-css) to set up a Github repository for this project (of course you'll need to change the title).
1. Do the [Jumpstart Labs Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) sections I0 through I4.  Pay attention to any error messages you get, both planned (because the tutorial walks you through a common error-guided workflow) and unplanned (likely for things like spelling errors).  You'll see all these messages again and again when you're building Rails apps, so it's helpful to start getting familiar with which portions of the message you should pay attention to (and maybe put into Google if you can't figure out what caused it).
2. Here's a [helpful gist with common Blogger problems](https://gist.github.com/burtlo/4970471) if you're running into issues with routes, deleting, partials, and `redirect_to`.
3. If you're feeling ambitious, add in authentication in section I5. Warning: There is currently an error in this section of the tutorial.  Make sure to enter the :username parameter into both your _form.html.erb and authors controller.  Otherwise you will see an error like this: "authors.username may not be NULL:"
4. If you're feeling very ambitious, try doing the final Extras section I6.
5. Don't forget to deploy your app to Heroku!  [Review Heroku deployment here.](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/deploy_a_rails_app)

## Extra Credit:

1. Michael Hartl guides you through [creating a sample app using scaffolding](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/a-demo-app#top) as the first stage of his Rails tutorial.  Just do chapter 2 -- you'll be doing the rest of the tutorial anyway later on during the Rails unit.
2. If you aren't comfortable with git, either skip ahead a few lessons to the [introductory section on git](/web-development-101/git-basics) or skip any of the `$ git ... ` commands for now.  They're essential to learn eventually but non-essential right now (it's sort of like saving your files on Dropbox).
