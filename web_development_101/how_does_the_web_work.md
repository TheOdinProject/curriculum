### <a id="introduction"></a> Introduction
Before you can understand how to *program* the web, you need to understand the web itself on a more granular level than you probably do now.  Some of this stuff is necessary just to have a more holistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working (and to not sound like a total newbie when talking to other developers about it).
