# How Does the Web Work?
<!-- *Estimated Time: 1-2 hrs* -->
<!-- update: Web Developer Tools moved to new lesson. -->

Before you can understand how to *program* the web, you need to understand the web itself on a more granular level than you probably do now.  Some of this stuff is necessary just to have a more wholistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working (and to not sound like a total newbie when talking to other developers about it), but other aspects (like HTTP) will come up again and again when you start programming.  
## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What is the internet?
* How is information broken down and sent?
* What are packets?
* What is a "client"?
* What is a "server"?
* What is HTTP and how does an HTTP request work?
* What are DNS servers?
* What is HTML and how is it used?
* What is CSS and how is it used?
* What's the difference between static and dynamic web pages?
* What happens when you click "search" on google.com?

## Assignment:
1. For a basic and painless Internet overview, check out [Don't Fear The Internet's Simple Primer (video)](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/01-not-tubes/). *Note: Sorry if it is redirecting to spammy sites, they have been hacked before*
2. Check out [How Does the Internet Work? (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj7A2YDgIWE) for a basic explanation of how packets work.
3. Harvard's David Malan explains internet basics in [this lecture (start at 52:15)](http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/lectures/7/week7m-720p.mp4) from his popular Intro to Computer Programming course.  Note that we will cover the "developer tools" of web browsers that he talks about around minute 58 in an upcoming lesson.  We'll also get heavily into HTML later in the curriculum.
4. He dives further into HTTP in a [short 3-minute video (video)](http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/http/http-720p.mp4).
