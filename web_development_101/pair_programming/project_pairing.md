### Introduction

Now you know what pair programming is and how to set up your computer for it. Hopefully you've found yourself someone to pair with because we are about to build something that will be much easier with two heads.

**Note:** If you are unable to find someone to pair with, or don't wish to pair program, don't worry. Just make sure you are comfortable with the concepts in the last two lessons, mark this complete, and go on to the next section.

### Before Starting

Some things to keep in mind for when you start building:

1. If you haven't already, make sure to do the [git lessons](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/introduction-to-git). While you are working on the project, it can live on the shared Cloud 9 workspace, but once you are done, you'll want to have a place to put it for both of you.
2. Remember those documentation pages we had you bookmark in the [Introduction to the Front End](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/introduction-to-the-front-end) lesson? Feel free to reference them for reminders as well as ideas.
3. Take advantage of the fact that you are pairing: pick each other's brains! Maybe the Navigator can look something up while the Driver is typing? Work together to solve the problem!

Enough talk! Let's build!

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

  [The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management system where you work for a period of time then take a short break, then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on. You learned about it in the [Gearing Up](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/gearing-up) lesson. This is also a useful system for switching between Driver and Navigator roles when pairing.

  We are going to make a Pomodoro clock similar to [this](http://romantic-trouble.surge.sh/) which will count down twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again. If you've been following along the curriculum, you should have most of the tools you will need to make it. But if you do have problems, there are two of you! Put your minds together and figure it out.

### Next Steps

Congratulations! You now know how to pair program and have created a real project with that partner. Maybe you got along great, maybe you didn't. If you didn't, go back to the [Pairing Category](https://forum.theodinproject.com/c/pairs) and see if you can find another person to pair with. Either way, we encourage you to keep on pairing for the rest of the lessons and projects in the Odin Project. You will learn more, and produce better code. Not to mention, you will be developing experience in a skill that many employers look for!
