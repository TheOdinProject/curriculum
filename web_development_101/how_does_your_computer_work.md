# Step Back... How Does Your Computer Work?
<!-- *Estimated Time: 3-6 hrs* -->

This isn't a course about rebuilding your hard drive but it is useful for you to understand the high level overview of what's going on to make your computer function.  That's partly because you'll see the same patterns showing up when you're telling servers what to do and partly because you're going to have to talk to your computer in a way that it understands anyway so you'd better speak a little of its language.


## The Command Line

Raise your hand if you're scared of the command line.  Yes, we have this image of developers staring at a black screen with white or green text flashing across while they wildly enter incomprehensible commands and hack into the corporate mainframe (spilling soda and wiping cheetos off their keyboard no doubt as well).

That black screen (or window) is the command line, where you're able to enter commands that your computer will run for you.  And while that image of a programmer is a bit overdone, the command line really is sort of like our base of operations, from which we'll launch other programs to do our "real developing" in.  It has a syntax of its own which is different but not all that difficult to pick up.  You'll be entering the same commands dozens of times anyway, so you'll get pretty good at it in a short period of time.

## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*


* What is the command line?
* How do you open it on your computer?
* How can you navigate into a particular file directory?
* How can you create a directory?
* How can you destroy a directory or file?
* How can you rename a directory or file?
* Why are file permissions important?

## Assignment:

*Note: Many of these assume you're using a Mac or a Linux environment.  If you'd like to try one out, check out [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/join/GRrt3VYaHE8?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral), which is a free Ruby/Rails web-based development environment.  They have a terminal window you can practice with.*

2. Dip your toe into the command line with this [basic overview from Treehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics)
1. To gain a better understanding of your command line, start with this [simple walkthrough by Avi of the Flatiron School](https://gist.github.com/aviflombaum/9d6f7448119bae3a24ee).
2. To dig a little deeper, take this [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw.  It can be a bit rough at times because the explanations are a bit sparse, so don't worry if you don't absorb it all the first time.  You'll get quite familiar with the few commands that you end up using every day over the course of the next few weeks anyway.
