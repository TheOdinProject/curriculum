# Git 101
<!-- *Estimated Time: 2 hrs* -->

We mentioned Git briefly in the previous course [Introduction to Web Development](/introduction-to-web-development/tools-of-the-trade) and you've had a chance to use it during the [Rails project](/web-development-101/ruby-on-rails) but now it's time to actually dig in a bit more and understand what Git really is.

To get a good high-level overview of Git plus a series of how-to commands and explanations, check out [Getting to Know Git](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-to-know-git).  Then

## Assignment:

1. If you haven't already, watch the following videos (which were linked in the post above as well) from [Github's Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/GitHubGuides):
    
    1. [Git Basics #1: What is VCS?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo) will introduce you to version control for developers.
    2. [Git Basics #2: What is Git?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhtzxPU7Bz0) will start getting a bit more into a Git workflow.
    3. [Git Basics #3: Get Going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmnSyrRBKTw) will show your how to configure your git initially.  You likely did some of these steps during the installation phase, so don't download it again.
    2. [Webcast: The Basics of Git and GitHub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4) will provide more of a linear and wholistic look at practical workflows when using Git.  Some of the early terminology is a bit developer-y and it is pretty wide-ranging, but just soak it in and save it for later.  You'll also see information about some helpful Help files and GUI tools to visualize Git.

1. Do the [Git Calisthenics](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/git-calisthenics) exercises for a follow-along walkthrough of pretty much everything you'll need with Git during the next few months.
2. Do the quick [Try Git exercises](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) as well.
