#Project Workflow
^ Blurb about setting up basic workflow items: ie, git and a decent text editor /vomit /rofl gedit

##Points to Ponder
^ ?? Drop notepad and gedit you fools.

##Your Task
Pick your text-editor, choose wisely - this will be a close companion of yours for awhile. (Or get both!)
- Sublime Text:
  - For [Windows](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
  - For [Linux](http://askubuntu.com/questions/172698/how-do-i-install-sublime-text-2-3)
  
- Atom:
  - For [Windows](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.9.0) - scroll to the bottom of the page and download *AtomSetup.exe*
  - For [Linux](https://codeforgeek.com/2014/09/install-atom-editor-ubuntu-14-04/)

##Additional Resources
^ Seems like overkill; maybe some git resources if absolutely necessary or some ideas about package manager on the text editors:

Really useful for workflow!!
