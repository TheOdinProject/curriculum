### Introduction
Before you can understand how to *program* the web, you need to understand the web itself on a more granular level than you probably do now.  Some of this stuff is necessary just to have a more holistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working (and to not sound like a total newbie when talking to other developers about it).

### Learning Outcomes
At the end of this lesson you should be able to:

<details>
  <summary>Describe what the <i>internet</i> is</summary>
  <ul><ul>
    <li>The internet is a network of linked computers from around the globe. Each of these computers communicate with each other in a specific format.</li>

 </details>
 
 <details>
  <summary>Describe what <i>packets</i> are and how they are used to transfer data</summary>
  <ul><ul>
    <li>Packets are the information of the internet. Packets are sent from the sender to the receiever in a specific format which contains all the information needed to communicate.</li>
  </ul></ul>
 </details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Understand the differences between a <i>webpage</i>, <i>web server</i>, <i>web browser</i> and <i>search engine</i></summary>
  <ul><ul>
    <li>A webpage is the page you look at in your browser</li>
    <li>A web server is the computer that has the code for how the webpage should look and act.</li>
    <li>A web browser is a program on a computer that displays the web page.</li>

 <details>
  <summary>Briefly explain what a <i>client</i> is</summary>
  <ul><ul>

  </ul></ul>
 </details>
 
 <details>
  <summary>Briefly explain what a <i>server</i> is</summary>
  <ul><ul>
    <li>A server is the computer that receives requests (as packets) from the client and responds with the appropriate data.</li>
  </ul></ul>
 </details>
 
 <details>
  <summary>Explain what <i>DNS servers</i> are</summary>
  <ul><ul>
    <li>DNS Servers are the "phone book" of the internet. They translate IP addresses into domain names.</li>
  </ul></ul>

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
  1. Watch this [BBC short](https://vimeo.com/128575085)  for an overview of how the Internet works.
  2. Supplement this with a [reading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work#Summary) and a [video](https://youtu.be/7_LPdttKXPc?t=46s).
  3. Read up on the [differences](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#Summary) between a webpage, web server and a search engine.
  4. Watch this [Google short](https://youtu.be/BrXPcaRlBqo) explaining what a web browser is; then find out what web browser you are using right [now](https://whatbrowser.org/).
  5. Now read about how one part of the web [interacts with another](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works#Clients_and_servers) and [read](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name#How_does_a_DNS_request_work) or [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA&feature=youtu.be&t=45s) a DNS request in action.
