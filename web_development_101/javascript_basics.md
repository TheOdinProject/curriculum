# Javascript 101
*Estimated Time: 6-8 hrs*

As we [saw before](http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/05/javascript/), Javascript is the in-browser code that gets run to make things on your webpage moveable and clickable, including the dropdown menus and hover effects you use every day.  It's time to dive in a bit more and start getting your hands dirty with some code.

This is also the first time you'll get to do some actual programming (HTML/CSS doesn't count because it just kind of sits there).  It should be fun!  You'll learn concepts (like, say, conditional statements) that are used in every programming language you'll ever learn, including Ruby.  Javascript just happens to let you implement them to do fun things in the browser.

This lesson will tend to focus on understanding the programming side of Javascript and the next lesson on jQuery will build on your knowledge here to actually allow you to interact with the elements on your webpage.

## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What is a scripting language?
* What is a variable?
* What is a string? An array? A boolean?
* What are events?

## Assignment:
1. Do [Codecademy's Javascript Sections 1-5](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) ("Getting Started with Programming" to "Control Flow"). If you want extra credit, do the full Javascript track... but we'll get to that in-depth later on in the curriculum.
2. Be sure to do [the Codecademy Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Project](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-x9DnD/0/1) once you've finished the learning section.
3. Go to [jsfiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net/) and play around with their tool -- it lets you type out some HTML, CSS, and Javascript and see it displayed for you right there.  It's great for just testing things out or solving simple problems, though it will feel a bit clunky if you're trying to do a whole project in it.  Use the "Run" button at the top to run your Javascript.
    1. Another in-browser IDE to explore for HTML/CSS/JS is [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/).
    2. You can also try the Javascript section of [Codecademy Labs](http://labs.codecademy.com/) -- it doesn't support HTML and CSS, but it does provide you with a helpful javascript console.
4. Start thinking about how to use code to solve more logical problems. As much as web development is an expression of creativity, it's also based in problem solving (and job interviewers certainly know that) so you'll want to shake the rust off that part of your brain.  [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a series of programming challenges that are best solved by using the power of computers (since many of them require you to perform simple mathematical operations on a very large scale).  Some of the later problems require so much repetition and computing power that you would need to find a more elegant way of solving it than the immediately obvious "brute force" solution.  We'll just do a couple of simpler ones here.  Solve these problems (try using [jsfiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net/) or [Codecademy Labs](http://labs.codecademy.com/) if you aren't comfortable working with your own files):
    1. [Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
    2. [Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers](http://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
    3. [Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor](http://projecteuler.net/problem=3)... just solve for numbers smaller than 1,000 and don't worry about making it efficient.  You won't need to do any crazy math -- think iteration and make the computer do the work.  Consider it extra credit to make your solution solve for larger numbers in a way that isn't too slow.
    4. No one said you could turn off your brain!
