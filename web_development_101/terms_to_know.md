# Terms to Know
<!-- *Estimated Time: 1-2 hrs* -->

Web technology land is full of strange terms and an alphabet soup of acronyms and it can be a bit overwhelming.  You won't need to know them all out of the gate, but there are some that you will need to be familiar with before getting started.

## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*


* How to define each of the terms in the Flatiron list below.
* The basics of each term on the list from Smashing Magazine below.

## Assignment:

1. Take a look at this [list of term definitions](http://prework.flatironschool.com/web-development/#tocAnchor-1-5-1) and make sure you have at least a competent understanding of each one (click on it to bring up the full definition).  Don't skip this and assume you know it all -- there will be at least a few that are worth nailing down.  Flashcards help.
2. Browse through this [great (though design-focused) list of terms from Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/21/web-design-industry-jargon-glossary-and-resources/).  It's not essential that you know all the unfamiliar ones down cold, but you'll keep seeing this stuff again and again so it's good to have a working knowledge of what they are.  The article also contains lots of great links to dig deeper into anything you don't understand.
