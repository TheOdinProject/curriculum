#Web Developer Tools
Blurbbbbb

##Points to Ponder
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What is your browser's Web Inspector (aka Developer Tools) and how can you use it to poke around in a page's HTML?

##Assignment
1. Check out [a bit more on developer tools](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/03-the-browser/) (*Note: Sorry if it is redirecting to spammy sites, they have been hacked before*) from Don't Fear the Internet, since getting familiar with your browser's tools will help you out quite a bit as you start poking around the web pages you or others have made.
2. Why are we spending so much time looking at developer tools for the browser?  Because they are your gateway to seeing the inner workings of websites and will help you figure out what's wrong with your own.  You can also use them to scrape data from other people's websites, which you will learn about by reading Dan Nguyen's [Intro to Web Scraping](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/web-scraping/) and then the following chapter on [Meeting your Web Inspector](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/web-inspecting-html/).  Take a few minutes to go mucking around on your favorite websites and seeing how they're organized.
3. (Optional) If you want to learn a bit more about the amazingly useful developer tools for your browser, check out [this 10-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcFnnxfA70g) that goes over them in some detail.  A bit of knowledge here can save you a lot of time debugging later!


##Additional Resources
*This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something*

* [A longer course digging deeply into your browser's developer tools from Code School](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/)
* [Pesticide.io is a chrome extension that puts a bright box around every `<div>` on the page](http://pesticide.io/).  That makes it easy to see the makeup of a page without scrolling through all the elements on it with your developer tools.
