### Introduction

Raise your hand if you're scared of the command line.  Yes, we have this image of developers staring at a black screen with white or green text flashing across while they wildly enter incomprehensible commands and hack into the corporate mainframe (spilling soda and wiping cheetos off their keyboard no doubt as well).

That black screen (or window) is the command line, where you're able to enter commands that your computer will run for you.  And while that image of a programmer is a bit overdone, the command line really is sort of like our base of operations, from which we'll launch other programs to do our "real developing" in.  It has a syntax of its own which is different but not all that difficult to pick up.  You'll be entering the same commands dozens of times anyway, so you'll get pretty good at it in a short period of time.

In this introductory lesson to the command line, you will learn how to navigate around your computer and how to manipulate files and directories(also known as folders) all from the comfort of the command line. As you will soon see this is not as difficult as you may think. The commands you will learn in this lesson are very intuitive so don't let the the prospect of using the command line for the first time intimidate you.

### Why learn this now?

You will be making heavy use of the command line throughout this curriculum, the installations project which is at the end of this section will require you to install a lot of different kinds of software through the command line and you will be using GIT(more on this later) primarily with the command line. Bigger picture, you will be using the command line on a daily basis in your career as a software developer. It will be an indispensable skill in your toolset.

### Learning Outcomes
Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment

* What is the command line?
* How do you open it on your computer?
* How can you navigate into a particular file directory?
  - Where will `cd` on its own navigate you to?
  - Where will `cd ..` navigate you to?
* How can you display the name of the directory you are currently in?
* How can you display the contents of the directory you are currently in?
* How can you create a new directory?
* How can you create a new file?
* How can you destroy a directory or file?
* How can you rename a directory or file?


### Assignment
Note: Many of these assume you're using a Mac or a Linux environment. You can skip ahead to the installations section and follow the instructions to install Linux or use an online IDE like [cloud 9](https://c9.io/), which has a terminal window you can practice with.

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
  1. To get an initial high-level overview of the command line, check out [A Command Line Crash Course](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course) from the Viking Code School Prep Work.
  2. To layer on a bit more depth, read through [chapter 1 of conquering the command line](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/basics).
  3. (Optional) If you'd still like some more practice, complete the first 2 sections of [this interactive Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line) to get practice navigating and manipulating directories and files.

### Exercise
In this exercise you will practice creating files and directories and deleting them.

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
  1. Create a new directory in your home directory with the name `test`
  2. Navigate to the `test` directory
  3. Create a new file called `test.txt` *hint: use the `touch` command*
  4. Navigate back out of the `test` directory
  5. Delete the `test` directory
</div>

That's it, you're done with command line basics.  This stuff will become second nature to you if you will commit to doing most things from the command line from here on.  Things such as moving and copying files are done much more efficiently through the command line once you've got the command engrained... even if it feels like more of a hassle at this point.


### Additional Resources
This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something.

* [This book](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) is a great resource for mastering the command line.  It goes into more depth than you really need at this point, so just go through chapters 1 and 4.  Feel free to refer to the others (they're great!) whenever you like.
* [This video series](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/) by Wes Bos is seriously great.. he goes a little more in depth and shows you how to do some real magic on the command line.  Not required info.. but seriously effective.
* If you want to deconstruct a particularly strange shell command or learn how Bash works through guess-and-check, [ExplainShell.com](http://explainshell.com/) is your solution.
