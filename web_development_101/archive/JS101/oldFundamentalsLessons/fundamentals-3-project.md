## Congratulations!

You have been through a _ton_ of content, and it would not be surprising if you were feeling rather overwhelmed at this point.  Let's take a little time to slow down and practice this stuff with more coding exercises.  I'll warn you now: some of these get pretty difficult, but if you've done the lessons you should have covered everything you need to know to solve them.  Don't be afraid to go back and review if you find that you can't remember something, that's part of the process.  If you get stuck come join us in the chatroom!

### Your Assignment

At this point you just need a little more practice!  Go back to the [JavaScript exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises) that we introduced in the Fundamentals 2 project and complete the following:

* calculator
* simonSays
* palindromes
* snakeCase
* caesar
* fibonacci
* pigLatin

### Want MORE practice?

You really can't spend too much time reviewing and practicing the fundamentals that we've covered here and luckily for you there are several websites that offer just this type of thing. Seriously, the better you grasp and the more fluently you can use the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, the easier the hard stuff is going to come to you when we get to it.  Take a minute to check out the following links.

* [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) - an Odin favorite.  Uses a neat command-line interface to download and submit exercises and allows you to give and get feedback on your solutions.
* [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) - A neat gamified system with leveled exercises.  As you complete more exercises you level up and access more difficult ones.
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Similar in setup to CodeWars, but this site is more focused on interview question type tasks.  Some companies even use this site to interview candidates.
