# Introduction to the Front End
<!-- *Estimated Time: 1 hr* -->

The "front end languages" live in the browser.  After you type in an address in the address bar at the top and hit Enter, your browser will receive at least an HTML file from the web server.  That file will likely tell the browser to go and also ask for a CSS file and a Javascript file as well (probably many more than one, but we'll keep it simple).  

Each of these languages performs a separate but very important function and they work harmoniously together to determine how the web page is STRUCTURED (HTML), how it LOOKS (CSS), and how it FUNCTIONS (Javascript).  And keep in mind that your *browser* handles figuring out how to make these files into a functioning webpage (not the server).

Front end web development is NOT design (you won't be playing around in Photoshop or anything), but a front end developer *does* apply the work of designers to the webpage by translating their well-designed layouts into real code.  The front end developer stands between the designer on one end and the back end developer on the other, translating the design into code and plugging the data from the back end developer into the right spots.  He or she must also handle all the possible interactions that the user may need to make with the page.

On the front end, you will need to be highly conscious of who your user is and how they will be interacting with your webpage because you are building their gateway to your page or product.  This may mean gaining a strong understanding of accessibility and things like responsive development down the line... but first you need to build up your toolkit and pick up the fundamentals of the frontend languages.

In the following lessons, you'll get a healthy understanding of each of the three frontend languages (and jQuery, the most popular Javascript library).  To get warmed up, we'll just start at the high level.

## Points to Ponder

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*


* What is the role of HTML in a web page?
* What is the role of CSS in a web page?
* What is the role of Javascript in a web page?

## Assignment:
1. Read a brief intro to front end development from this [Interview with Nick Schaden](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-front-end-web-development/)
1. Get a high level overview of how all three languages (and jQuery) work together in a web page in this brief learn.jquery.com post on the [Anatomy of a Web Page](http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/getting-started/).
2. If you didn't the first time, check out [this 10-minute video on your browser's developer tools](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TkfcC53G0), which should make a bit more sense to you anyway now.
