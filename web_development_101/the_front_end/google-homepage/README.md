Google homepage project: START

I need to make a replica of the Google homepage, though only aesthetically.
I put the image in, and the navs, just gotta put the form and position everything adn give
it the look.

This was easier than I thought. though I feel like I am not doing it in the 'proper' way, I got it to look the part using a lot of margin tricks. The <position> element really helped a lot! Percentages also.
