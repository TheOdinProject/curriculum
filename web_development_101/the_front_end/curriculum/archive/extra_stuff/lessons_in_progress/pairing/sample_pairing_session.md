# A Sample Remote Pairing Session

If all of that seemed a bit confusing, here's a step-by-step workflow for remote pairing.

1. Get your partner's Screenhero contact information and agree on a time (remember time zones!)
1. Find and "call" your partner on Screenhero and share your screen
2. Either use Screenhero voice calling or Skype voice calling to talk with your partner
1. Get your [pomodoro timer](http://tomato-timer.com/) fired up so you know when it's time to switch roles from driver to navigator and back.
1. Come up with your battle plan for the project
1. [If using git] Create the public Github repo for the project
1. **Code! Switch! Code! Switch! Repeat n times!**
1. Push your code to the Github repository or email it to the partner whose computer wasn't used
2. Have a cookie, you've earned it.
1. Schedule another session!
