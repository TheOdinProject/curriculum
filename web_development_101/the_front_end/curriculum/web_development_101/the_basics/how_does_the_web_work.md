### Introduction
Before you can understand how to program the web, you need a more rigorous understanding of the web itself than you likely have now. These concepts provide a more holistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working and will enable you to talk intelligently with other developers about your work.

### Learning Outcomes
At the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

<details>
