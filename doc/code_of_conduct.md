## The Odin Project Code of Conduct

The Odin Project's online communities are intended to be informative and relaxing spaces where Odinites can find answers to their programming questions or simply hang out.  Since we aim to be an inclusive and friendly community, we request that all Odinites follow the guidelines laid out in this Code of Conduct.  Following these guidelines will ensure that all Odinites have a positive learning experience:

1. Be polite, welcoming, and inclusive.

2. Inappropriate conduct and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Any such remarks will result in an immediate ban.

3. Actions that seem specifically designed to test the limits of what is offensive and serve no other purpose (i.e., trolling) will not be tolerated, and such sessions will be immediately terminated.

4. Do not post someone's personal information or post links to personal information.

Additionally, The Odin Project and its core members reserve the right to ban or otherwise disable the account(s) of users in defiance with this code of conduct or for any other reason they see fit.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

  * Using welcoming and inclusive language.

  * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

  * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

  * Focusing on what is best for the community.

  * Showing empathy towards other community members.

## Our Responsibilities

The Odin Project's core members are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The Odin Project's core members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at <a href="mailto:theodinprojectcontact@gmail.com.com">theodinprojectcontact@gmail.com</a>. After investigating and reviewing each complaint, the project team will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
