### Introduction

Everything that a user does in a browser creates events, whether it's moving the mouse around or clicking or typing or just loading the page.  These and other events are at the heart of Javascript -- they are how you turn that user interaction with your website into helpful responsive actions.  The key to working with events is just building a model in your head for how the browser "listens" for events by default and how you can use that to your advantage.

Effects are like window-dressing for your user experience.  They represent the neat transitions (like fades or slides) that you can easily apply to elements using jQuery.  Often you'll make certain events trigger certain effects, e.g. user moves mouse over shopping cart and it slides down the shopping cart mini-window.

### Learning Outcomes

* What are Events?
* How do you bind an event to an element?
* How do events "bubble" through the DOM?
* How do you stop the default thing an event would do?
* How do you set up an event so it will also apply to elements created after you created the event listener? (hint: delegate)
* How do you unbind events from an element?
* How would you listen for a keyboard key being pressed?
* How do you make an element fade in or out?
* How do you change the amount of time it takes for an element to fade in or out?
* What happens if you trigger a whole bunch of effects on the same element at the same time (e.g. 12 slide-outs)?
