### The end of the JavaScript course!

Completing the JavaScript course is a major milestone! Congratulations! You've learned a lot of major JavaScript concepts like prototypes, closures, promises, and event loops. Take a moment to reflect on how far you've come.

At this point, you can create phenomenal and dynamic frontends, all using vanilla JavaScript. However, the frontend isn't over yet. You'll be learning about accessibility, responsive design and about [React](https://react.dev/), a library for creating interfaces, in the upcoming courses. You've already experienced the pain of manually updating the DOM with respect to your underlying data changes, and that's where React simplifies the process.
