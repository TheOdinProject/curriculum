# Project: Building Single Page Websites using Angular.js and Backbone.js

This project has two possibilities -- you can use Backbone.js if you'd like something that's a bit more explicit and well documented or Angular.js if you'd like to try something a bit more cutting edge.  Just pick one, don't try both (focus!).

## Your Task

If you've chosen Backbone, [do the beginner and intermediate tutorials here](http://backbonetutorials.com/) to learn Backbone and get a great overview of Javascript frameworks.

If you've chosen Angular instead, first glance over the beginner tutorial from the link above to get a feel for how these frameworks operate, then [do this Angular.js tutorial which has you build a real web app](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial).

In both cases, save your solution using Git and submit it below when you've finished.
