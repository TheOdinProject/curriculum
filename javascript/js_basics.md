# Javascript Basics
  
Javascript is here to stay and, if you want to be a full-stack developer, you're going to need to learn more than just simple looping and DOM manipulation with jQuery.  You will need to understand how Javascript actually works in the same way you did with Ruby in order to learn Rails.  

It's actually quite easy to hack together simple browser interactions using a bit of Javascript and a healthy dose of jQuery.  Your mission, though, is to be able to do a lot more than just hack together simple pages -- you need to feel comfortable building out completely new functionality in Javascript and working within large and established frameworks and code bases.  That means digging deep into what makes the language tick and what patterns get used again and again in the real world.

You should already have completed the [Web Development 101 Javascript lesson](/web-development-101/javascript-basics), and this will really be a deeper coverage of each of those issues (much like Ruby Basics was for Ruby).

## Points to Ponder

This is a fairly long list of things to pay attention to but it should be mostly review.

* How do you include a Javascript file in your HTML file?
* How do you include Javascript directly in your HTML code?
* How can you write and run your Javascript code using programs like [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)?
* How do you create a new object using the "Constructor" method?
* How do you create a new object using the "Literal" method?
* What does JS return if you try to access an object's attribute that doesn't exist?
* How do you add items to or remove items from an array?
* What is the difference between `=`, `==`, and `===`?
* Are these "truthy" or "falsy" in JS: `"0"`,`NaN`,`null`,`"words"`,`""`,`[]`, `undefined`,`{}`, 1, 0?
* How do you get the length of a string?
* How do you find a value within a string?
* How does a "switch" statement work?
* How can you use objects to accomplish the same task?
* How do you set up a `for` loop?  A `for...in` loop?
* How do you set up a `while` loop?  
* How do you break out of a loop or skip to the next iteration?
* What are "reserved words"?
* How do you concatenate two arrays together?
* How do you sort arrays?  Reverse them?
* How do you use the `#forEach` method to print each item in an array?
* How are Javascript objects similar to hashes in Ruby?
* How are functions declared (two ways)?
* What are "anonymous functions"?  How are they similar to blocks in Ruby?
* How can you pass a function arguments?
* What does a function return?
* What are "immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE)"?
* If a function has been saved to a variable `some_var`, what's the difference between how you would pass the function itself around instead of running it immediately when called? (hint: parentheses)
* How do you test what the Type of an object is? (e.g. string, number, function, undefined...)
* What is `this` set to in Javascript?  
* How is `this` similar to and different from Ruby's `self`?
* How to you make a variable in the global scope?  The local scope?
* Why are closures useful?
* How would you use a closure to "close" a value within a function?
* How does `#bind` make your life simpler when thinking about closures and scopes?

## Your Assignment

2. Read [Javascript is Super Sexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-is-super-sexy/), which is a good post for getting fired up to learn Javascript.
1. Finish [the entire Codecademy Javascript track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) (you already did up to lesson 5).
2. Glance through [Javascript 101 from learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/) to fill in gaps in the Codecademy course.  The stuff on scopes and closures will be covered in the later section in more depth.
