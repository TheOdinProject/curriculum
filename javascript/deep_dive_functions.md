# Really Understanding Javascript Functions

We keep coming back to how Javascript loves functions.  Let's dig a little deeper.  One pattern which you'll keep bumping into again and again and again is the "module pattern", which lets you 

## Points to Ponder

* How do you call a function "method-style"?
* How do you call a function "function-style"?
* What do `#apply` and `#call` do?
* When should you use a constructor?
* When are arguments for a function required?
* How can a function take another function as an argument?
* How can a function return another function?  How do you then run that returned function?
* How do you indicate an argument isn't required?
* How might you access overflowing (extra) arguments?
* What are surrogates and why are they used?
* What does it mean to "namespace" your code?
* How do you namespace your code using modules? 

## Your Assignment

1. Read  [The Design Of Code: Organizing Javascript from Alistapart](http://alistapart.com/article/the-design-of-code-organizing-javascript) up to and including the "Building a Module" section for an introduction to the module pattern.
2. Read [Namespacing and using Modules in JS](http://www.codethinked.com/preparing-yourself-for-modern-javascript-development) for a fuller explanation of those two topics.  It covers a fair bit of ground, but try to use these patterns in your next project (and all the following ones) and they'll get ingrained in your head.
