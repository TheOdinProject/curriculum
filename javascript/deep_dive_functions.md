### Introduction
We keep coming back to how Javascript loves functions.  Let's dig a little deeper.  One pattern which you'll keep bumping into again and again and again is the "module pattern", which lets you group functions and variables logically to keep your code organized and maintainable.

### Learning Outcomes

* How do you call a function "method-style"?
* How do you call a function "function-style"?
* What do `#apply` and `#call` do?
* When should you use a constructor?
* When are arguments for a function required?
* How can a function take another function as an argument?
* How can a function return another function?  How do you then run that returned function?
* How do you indicate an argument isn't required?
* How might you access overflowing (extra) arguments?
* What are surrogates and why are they used?
* What does it mean to "namespace" your code?
* How do you namespace your code using modules?

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
1. Read  [The Design Of Code: Organizing Javascript from Alistapart](http://alistapart.com/article/the-design-of-code-organizing-javascript) up to and including the "Building a Module" section for an introduction to the module pattern.
2. Read [Namespacing and using Modules in JS](http://www.codethinked.com/preparing-yourself-for-modern-javascript-development) for a fuller explanation of those two topics.  It covers a fair bit of ground, but try to use these patterns in your next project (and all the following ones) and they'll get ingrained in your head.
