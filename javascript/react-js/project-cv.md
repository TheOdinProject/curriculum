### Introduction

Congrats, you made it to the first project. In this project, you will be creating a small CV application. It's a great project to get you started, because it includes a lot of the basic concepts.

### Just a quick reminder

Learning a new technology is never easy. Along the way you might think: "Well, I could easily implement this in plain Javascript". **BUT** don't let that demotivate you. If you keep pushing, you will end up way more productive than you have been before and with the ability to add a new skill to yous skillset.

So let's get started.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
1. Create a new project using `npx create-react-app cv-project`. If you forgot how it works, check out the previous lessons. Also make sure you set up a Github repository for you project, to push your progress.
2. Remove all the unnecessary code created by `create-react-app`.
3. Think about how to structure your application into components. Your application should include:
   1. A section where to add general information like name, email, phone number.
   2. A section where to add your educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study)
   3. A section where to add practical experience (company name, position title, main tasks of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)
4. Make sure to include an edit and a submit button either for each section or for the whole CV, however you prefer. The submit button should submit your form, and display the value of your input fields in html elements. The edit button should add back the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. In those input fields you should of course be able to edit and resubmit the content. You're going to make heavy use of state and props, so make sure you understood those concepts.
5. Create a `components` folder in your `src` directory and add your components.
6. If you are familiar with bootstrap or any other CSS framework, feel free to use it. If not, don't worry, just include a `styles` folder in your `src` directory and continue with normal CSS, as you are conformable.
7. Don't forget to push your solution to Github, you can be proud of it, you achieved quite a lot here.
