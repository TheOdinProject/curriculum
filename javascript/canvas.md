# Using Canvas to Draw and More

Canvas is a great tool in HTML5 -- it basically provides a panel in which you can use Javascript and math to draw pretty much anything.  It's useful for everything from gaming to image optimization.  In our case, we'll focus on games because it gives you a chance to flex your pure Javascript muscles creatively.  For the first time so far, you'll get to build games that operate dynamically in 2-D space (not confined to a grid).  Use that power only for good...

## Points to Ponder

* What is Canvas?
* How do you set up a Canvas element?
* How do you draw a 5 pixel black square with a red outline?
* How can you use refreshes to animate things?
* How would you make a ball that bounces off walls?
* How would you make two balls that bounce off walls or each other?
* What happens if you refresh too many calculations or too rapidly?

## Your Assignment

1. Do chapters 1-6 in the [Canvas Deep Dive book](http://joshondesign.com/p/books/canvasdeepdive/toc.html), which is the best explanation I've seen.
2. Browse through the [No Tears Guide to HTML5 Games from html5rocks.com](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/) in preparation for your next project.

* [Canvas Deep Dive book](http://joshondesign.com/p/books/canvasdeepdive/toc.html) chapters 7-14 get deep into how you can use Canvas as a sweet graphics and gaming tool.  Out of scope for this course, but could be fun if that's your thing.
