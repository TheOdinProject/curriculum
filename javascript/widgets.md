Working with jQuery is a whole lot of fun... and here's why.  jQuery basically drives all the nifty tooltips, modals, lightboxes, sliders, and other widgets you see on a webpage.  Just about everything you've ever seen on the web can be done with a combination of the Javascript and jQuery you now know.  Let's take a look at some of them in greater depth.

We covered a [section on design in the HTML/CSS Course](/html5-and-css3) which may be useful to check back on if it's been awhile.  Lots of these widgets and effects are best used judiciously -- it's okay to go overboard while you're testing things out but your user doesn't want to have to wait for a whole bunch of fancy-looking stuff to happen on the page so don't go crazy in a production setting.

### Points to Ponder

* What is jQuery UI and why is it particularly useful for you?
* How do you include jQuery UI in your project?
* How do you use jQuery UI?
* Where are the docs for jQuery UI?

### Your Assignment

1. Read about [jQuery UI from learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/)
2. Browse through the [jQuery UI demos which let you see all of the effects in action](http://jqueryui.com/demos/) and include the source code.  Think of what you can build!
3. If you want further widget inspiration, [check out this list of 50 jQuery plugins from tutorialzine](http://tutorialzine.com/2013/04/50-amazing-jquery-plugins/) (or do it to see what plugins you might want to use yourself).
