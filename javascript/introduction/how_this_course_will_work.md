### Introduction

JavaScript! Love it or hate it, working in web means you'll have to deal with it at some point. In this course, we will dive deeper into the JavaScript language itself and explore many ways JavaScript gets used on the front end, including topics such as prototypal inheritance, modularization, bundling, asynchronous code, and JavaScript testing.

It's important that we get practical experience with these fundamentals in more vanilla contexts before we dive into making more complex front ends with tools like React. Those kinds of tools often have very specific ways of doing things that may seem like magic or even counter-intuitive, but if you approach them with a good foundation of JavaScript and frontend development, you will have a much better time understanding what they're really doing under the hood.

#### For the Ruby folk

This course comes a little later in the Ruby path than in the JavaScript path; you will have the benefit of some prior exposure to some of these concepts **but** be wary that just because something looks the same or even has the same name as something in Ruby, doesn't mean it works in exactly the same way. As long as you stay aware of that, you'll be sure to do great!

### The journey

The way these lessons will work will be very similar to what you've done so far, so keep at it. You're going to have forgotten things from previous courses. You're going to forget things you learn in this course as you go along, and again in later courses. Remind yourself that [you do not need to memorize everything you learn](https://dev.to/theodinproject/memorization-and-learning-to-code-1b6h).

We will cover a lot of ground and your brain may melt down a few times, but don't worry, it's just a flesh wound! The learning journey *is* hard, so rest well, patch 'er up and keep going!

**Enough talk - get learning!**
