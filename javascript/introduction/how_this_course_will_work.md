### Introduction

JavaScript is the future of the web. More and more of the logic is making its way to the client side in order to facilitate lightning-fast user experiences. JavaScript is even moving to the server side with Node.js. That's why in this course we'll be diving deep into it to make sure you come out with a good understanding of how it works.

You've already completed the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), right? Good, because now we'll be moving at warp speed into new frontiers. This section will cover a lot of ground and your brain may melt down a few times, but don't worry, that's just a flesh wound. Patch 'er up and keep going! When in doubt, build something.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- How the JavaScript course is structured and organized.
- The difference between Ruby and JavaScript tracks.
- What prerequisites are needed before starting this course.
- The format and structure of lessons in this course.
- What to expect from projects and assignments.

### Course structure

How is this course set up? It depends a bit on the path you have selected:

<details markdown="block">

  <summary class="dropDown-header">Ruby Track</summary>

It starts with a deeper look at the basics, just like the [Ruby Programming course](/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming) did with Ruby. You don't need to have completed the Ruby Programming course or [the Ruby on Rails course](/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails) to understand these basics.

</details>

<details markdown="block">

  <summary class="dropDown-header">JavaScript Track</summary>

It starts with a deep look at JavaScript code organization and basic computer science concepts, finishing with a primer on creating and using a test suite for your project.

</details>

We won't be focusing deeply on the really basic coding items, so it will move quickly. You should, however, already have completed the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) -- specifically, the [JavaScript Basics section](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) -- before starting this course.

The last thing you'll do is a project which integrates everything you've learned so far in all the courses of this curriculum. This is the kind of project that you'll consider including in your portfolio as an example to demonstrate your web-development skills to prospective employers.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Read through this lesson to understand how the JavaScript course is structured and what you can expect as you progress through it.

#### Lesson format

There is a lot to cover, but this course has been broken up into bite-sized lessons and their accompanying projects. These projects will give you a chance to apply what you have learned and to show what you are capable of. After a few of them, you'll really start getting the hang of things.

#### In each lesson

1. We will introduce the topic briefly and provide you with a list of things you should pay attention to ("Points to Ponder").
1. You will be asked to do readings, watch videos, do online courses or otherwise consume content to initially learn the material.
1. Every few lessons you will be asked to build a larger project.
1. Finally, we will include supplemental resources and other potentially useful tidbits at the end of each lesson.
