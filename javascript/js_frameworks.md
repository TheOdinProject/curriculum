# Javascript MV* Frameworks Like Angular.js and Backbone.js (Optional)

Javascript frameworks take the ideas of templating, e.g. moving logic from your server to the client, to the next level.  With these frameworks, you can run your entire web application without ever reloading the page.  The frameworks are all different, but they typically combine templating tools with client-side models that use AJAX to stay current with your back end.

JS Frameworks can be blazing fast in terms of user experience (though they can take longer to load at first because there's a lot more going on than with a simple page).

You should be able to pick up a Javascript framework in a relatively short period of time since you'll be able to build a good mental model for how it works based on your understanding of Rails, but it's not technically required knowledge (yet) for being hired.  That said, being able to work comfortably with Backbone or Angular can make you a much more attractive candidate.

In this lesson, we've laid out resources for learning several different frameworks.  Backbone.js is typically the best for beginners because it's got the best documentation and has been around longest (so more support).  Angular is another well documented framework that's coming on strong.  As with the Ruby/Python Rails/Django conversations, what you should do is pick one and learn it well, and then you'll be able to pick up another much easier.

## Points to Ponder

* What is a Javascript framework good for?
* How do frameworks provide similar functionality to Rails' MVC architecture from the front end?
* How do models stay up do date with your database?
* How does clicking a link to another "page" in a single-page web app actually render a different "page" without making an HTTP request to the server?

## Your Assignment

Reading the following articles is required.  After that, it's up to you to choose which framework you'd like to dive into.  We've provided resources for Backbone.js, Angular.js and Ember.js below, but you should only choose one to begin with.

1. Read [A Journey through the Javascript MVC Jungle from Smashing Magazine](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/) for a good introduction to frameworks.  Don't get lost in the list of all the frameworks -- just understand the high level concepts of a framework and how you might want to make a decision about which one to choose.
2. Read [An Introduction to Full Stack Javascript](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/21/introduction-to-full-stack-javascript/) will give you context for using Javascript all the way through the stack.
3. Browse through the [Seven Frameworks of JS from Steven Anderson](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/)
