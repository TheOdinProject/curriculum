#### Style Guides
Javascript lets you do so many different things that it's easy to feel like you have no organizational structure.  Check out these style guides from industry leading companies to improve your stylistic instincts.

1. Read [Organizing your Code from learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/)
2. Browse through [AirBnB's JS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is very readable and helpful
3. If you want some more examples of style guides, check out [Github's JS Style Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20160219161525/https://github.com/styleguide/javascript), and the [Contributing to jQuery Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)

3. Browse ["Thinking Inside the Box with Vanilla Javascript" from Smashing Magazine](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/06/inside-the-box-with-vanilla-javascript/) to learn a few helpful JS functions
4. Glance over [Working with Regular Expressions in Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to see how your Regex knowledge transfers over.
5. Read [Speeding up Page Load Times in Rails by Jarmo Pertman](http://itreallymatters.net/post/45763483826/speeding-up-page-load-time-in-rails#.UvGCG0JdWUA) to see ways you lighten your page loads.
6. Watch [Principles of Security by Douglas Crockford (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKuFu19LgZA) for a security primer
