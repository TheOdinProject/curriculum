# Organizing Your Javascript Code and More

This is a catch-all section for helpful resources like Style Guides (so your code follows established conventions), libraries, regular expressions, page loading, Local Storage in the browser and security.

## Points to Ponder

* What is a "Style Guide" and why is it helpful for you as a beginner?
* What is the Underscore library and how does it make Javascript much more Ruby-like?
* How can you make sure not to make repeated and excessive jQuery calls to the DOM (e.g. constantly using `$("body")` or the like)? Hint: Use variables.
* How do you search through a text string with a Regular Expression in Javascript?
* How do you make your Javascript load faster to improve page load times?
* What basic security principles do you need to know?
* What is "LocalStorage" on your browser?
* How do you access this awesome feature?
* What are the limitations of using LocalStorage?

### Style Guides

Javascript lets you do so many different things that it's easy to feel like you have no organizational structure.  Check out these style guides from industry leading companies to improve your stylistic instincts.

1. Read [Organizing your Code from learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/)
2. Browse through [AirBnB's JS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is very readable and helpful
