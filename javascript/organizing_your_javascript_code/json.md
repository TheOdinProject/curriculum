### Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standardized format for structuring data. It is heavily based on the syntax for JavaScript objects. You will often encounter JSON formatted data when working with external servers or APIs - it is essentially the universal format for transmitting data on the web.

Fortunately, there isn't much to learn here. We're only including a lesson on it because some formatting rules can cause confusion if you aren't aware of them. Spend 10-15 minutes going through the following resources and you'll be good to go.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- What JSON is and why it is important.
- Two important JSON methods, `parse` and `stringify`.

### Assignment

1. This [JSON MDN tutorial]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) is probably all you need...
1. Read about the 2 JavaScript methods that you'll most often be using when dealing with JSON - [JSON.parse()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp) and [JSON.stringify()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp).
1. Mis-formatted JSON is a common cause of errors. This [JSON formatter website](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) lets you paste in JSON code and will search it for formatting errors.
