### Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standardized format for structuring data. It is heavily based on the syntax for JavaScript objects. You will often encounter JSON formatted data when working with external servers or APIs - it is essentially the universal format for transmitting data on the web.

Fortunately, there isn't much to learn here. We're only including a lesson on it because some formatting rules can cause confusion if you aren't aware of them. Spend 10-15 minutes going through the following resources and you'll be good to go.
