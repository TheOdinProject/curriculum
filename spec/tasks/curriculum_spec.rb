  # Notes: 5:55pm 1/30/14 by ERIK TRAUTMAN: 
  # We can't actually reproduce the bug with the content being saved as nil or blank ("")
  # Everything we tried got the rake task to throw an error, which is good because the real problem was that
  # it SILENTLY saved nil or blank content to the DB.  We can't reproduce the bug, so I'm willing to say
  # it may have been fixed by me before and I'm just being paranoid now.  We tried:
  # Tried modifying the Github API call to return nil, and the task throws an error which is good
  # Tried changing the response["content"] to be nil, and the task throws an error which is good
  # Tried changing the decoded_file to nil, error thrown
  # Tried changing the decoded_file to "", error thrown
  # Tried: intentionally saving one of the lesson.url's to an invalid URL so github returns
  #     a "file not found" type message.  
  # ... it seems that no matter how we tweak the inputs, we can't get the task to save "" or nil to the database
  # SO.. now the scope of this story is changed: no longer is it about fixing a bug, it's just about writing
  # normal happy path / sad path tests for the rake task.  The cases above should be good guides for what to test.

  # Useful development tidbits (keep these around for later people who want to test out this stuff):
