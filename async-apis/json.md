JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standardized format for structuring data.  It is heavily based on the syntax for JavaScript objects.  You will often encounter JSON formatted data when working with external servers or APIs - it is essentially the universal format for transmitting data on the web.

Fortunately there isn't much to learn here.  We're only including a lesson on it because some of the formatting rules can cause confusion if you aren't aware of them.  Spend 10-15 minutes going through the following resources and you'll be good to go.

## Your Assignment

1. [This MDN tutorial]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) is probably all you need...
2. Read about the 2 JavaScript methods that you'll most often be using when dealing with JSON - [JSON.parse()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp) and [JSON.stringify()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_stringify.asp).
3. Misformatted JSON is a common cause of errors. [This webpage](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) lets you paste in JSON code and will search it for formatting errors.
