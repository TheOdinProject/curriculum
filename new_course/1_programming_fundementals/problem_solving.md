# Problem Solving

Problem solving is perhaps the most crucial skill every respectable developer has. Learning a programming language, its syntax and semantics, is just the half of it. If you want to be a good developer that is in demand in the job market, you are going to have to acquire problem solving skills if you do not already have it.

You must have heard about problem solving before or you may find it to be pretty self explanatory. The one class you problably heard the term in a hundred times is math class, almost all of them. However, this term has a slightly different meaning in computer science.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

 - Explain the role of problem solving in computer science.
 - List techniques that you can use to improve your problem solving skills.

### Assignment
<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Read the first 3 pages of chapter 1 of the book [Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving](https://books.google.com/books/about/Think_Like_a_Programmer.html?id=r6XiBUBERG8C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). Before you go any farther, try to solve the "How to cross the river problem". Once you've solved it, read what the author has to say in the "Lessons Learned" section.
2. Read the rest of the first chapter and try to solve the problems before reading the solutions. It is crucial to pay extra attention to all of the "Lessons Learned" sections.

### Additional Resources
This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something.

* Read the rest of [Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1540326000&sr=8-3&keywords=think+like+a+programmer) (*not free*). This book's examples are in C++, but you will understand everything since the main idea of the book is to teach programmers to better solve problems. It's an amazing book and worth every penny. It will make you a better programmer.
