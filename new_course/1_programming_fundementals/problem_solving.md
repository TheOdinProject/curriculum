# Problem Solving

Problem solving is perhaps the most crucial skill every respectable developer has. Learning a programming language, its syntax and semantics, is just the half of it. If you want to be a good developer that is in demand in the job market, you are going to have to acquire problem solving skills if you do not already have it.

You must have heard about problem solving before or you may find it to be pretty self explanatory. The one class you problably heard the term in a hundred times is math class, almost all of them. However, this term has a slightly different meaning in computer science.

## Learning Outcomes

*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

* What does 'problem solving' mean in computer science?
* How do programming and problem solving complement eachother?
* What are some techniques you can apply to get better at problem solving?

### Assignment

1. Read the first 3 pages of the first chapter of [Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving](https://books.google.nl/books/about/Think_Like_a_Programmer.html?id=r6XiBUBERG8C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) book and before you go any futher try and solve the "How to cross the river problem" if you don't know it already, once you solve it move on to reading what the author has to say in the "lesson learned" section
2. Read the rest of the 1st chapter and try and attempt to solve the problems before going to the solution. It is crucial that you pay extra attention to all the "Lesson learned" sections of the problem.
