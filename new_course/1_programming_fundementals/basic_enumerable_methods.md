## Introduction

Enumerables are a set of methods that are available on certain collections in Ruby. A collection, as used throughout this course, is a number of items that are grouped together into one Ruby object, like  an `Array` or `Hash`.  These methods are handy for looping through the items in such a collection. They provide easy ways to perform common actions, and are among the most important tools for Rubyists.

There is a lot here, but these are built-in to make your life easier. We will run you through the ones that you will most commonly use. This certainly is not an exhaustive list. At the end of this lesson there is a link for you to find out more about other methods beyond what we go through here.

It will be beneficial for you to code along to test the examples as you work through this lesson, either in IRB or [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/ruby).

## Enumerable Methods
<br/>

### The `each` method
`each` is the most basic and flexible of the enumerable methods.

Calling the `each` method on an array will loop through each item in that array and perform a task, which you define in a code block that you state after calling `each`.  This is called passing a block to the method, which is similar to passing a variable. The task you want the method to perform can be as simple or complex as you need it to be.

One thing to note is that after performing its task, `each` only returns the original array. Because of this, the value it actually returns is generally not used. The action(s) in the code block it receives are what you are after (something to keep in mind when debugging your code).

A simple example of a good use for `each`: Say we want to print every word in an array of strings. We can use the `each` method on that array like so:

```ruby
my_array = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

my_array.each { |fruit| print fruit, " " }
#=> apple banana strawberry pineapple
```

Some enumerable methods are applied to hashes in exactly the same way as to arrays, while others are implemented differently depending on the type of collection used. The `each` method, for example, is utilized a bit differently for hashes. Each "item" in a hash is a key-value pair. If you call `each` on a hash, the item passed to the code block will be an array of the key and value [key, value].

```ruby
my_hash = { "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, "four" => 4}

my_hash.each do |item|
  print item, ""
end
#=> ["one", 1]["two", 2]["three", 3]["four", 4]
```

To allow you to better work with the keys and values, `each` allows you to pass the key and value as separate parameters when used on a hash. If you wanted to print the keys and values in a different format, for instance, you could do the following:

```ruby
my_hash = { "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, "four" => 4}

my_hash.each do |key, value|
  print key, ": ", value, "\n"
end
#=> one: 1
#   two: 2
#   three: 3
#   four: 4
```

<br/>

### The `each_with_index` method
This is nearly the same as the `each` method, but it provides additional functionality by receiving two parameters instead of one. The second parameter represents the index of your array, that is the position of the current item within that array. This allows you to do things that are a bit more complex.

If we take the above example, but instead we want to only print every other word from our array of strings, we can achieve that like so:

```ruby
my_array = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

my_array.each_with_index { |fruit, index| print fruit, " " if index % 2 == 0 }
#=> apple strawberry
```

<br/>

### `do` and `end`
What if the code block you want to pass is long? Too long to fit on one line? It starts to become less readable and look kind of unwieldy to use the curly braces around more than one line (although it is allowed). Another way (and the commonly accepted best practice), is to use `do` and `end` by replacing the curly braces in your code such that `{ |x| ... }` becomes:

```ruby
do |x|
  ...
  ...
  ...
end
```

Here is the previous example using `do` and `end` instead of curly braces:
```ruby
my_array.each_with_index do |fruit, index|
   print fruit, " " if index % 2 == 0
end
```

The best practice according to the style guides is to use `{ }` if your block consists of a single line and `do... end` if it spans multiple lines.

<br/>

### The `include?` method

You may have noticed this method has a `?` mark in the name. Recall from the methods lesson, that any method with a `?` at the end is a `predicate` method, which is Ruby convention for any method that strictly returns a Boolean, that is either `true` or `false`.

The `include?` method works exactly like you think it should. For example, if we are wanting to determine if a particular element exists in an array, we can use the `include?` method, and it will spit out `true` if that element is present or `false` if it is not.

You call the method on the array and pass it the element you are looking for like so:

```ruby
my_numbers = [5,6,7,8]

my_numbers.include?(6)
#=> true

my_numbers.include?(3)
#=> false
```

<br/>

### The `any?` method

You might be able to then guess what the `any?` method does.

Let's say we want to see if there is any number greater than 500 in a list of numbers, `any?` can tell us like so:

```ruby
my_numbers = [21, 42, 303, 499, 550, 811]

my_numbers.any? { |item| item > 500 }
#=> true

my_numbers.any? { |item| item < 20 }
#=> false
```

<br/>

### The `all?` method

The `all?` method is also fairly intuitive.

Say we want to check if all the words in our list are greater that 6 characters in length.

```ruby
my_array = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

my_array.all? { |word| word.length > 6 }
#=> false
```

(Special note to keep in mind while debugging: `all?` will return `true` unless an item fails to meet the condition. So if you call it on an empty array, there are no items to fail, and it will return `true`)

<br/>

### The `none?` method

As you might expect `none?` performs the opposite function from `all?`:

```ruby
my_array.none? { |word| word.length < 4 }
#=> true
```

<br/>

### The `count` method
This method returns an integer representing the number of items within the array or hash that meet
the condition(s) set forth in the block that you pass. Like `each`, this method takes a block with
one parameter (or two - key and value - when called on a hash).

For example, we may want to know how many words in our array have more than 6 letters. To find
that out, we can use the `count` method.

```ruby
my_array = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

my_array.count { |fruit| fruit.length > 6 }
#=> 2
```

Alternatively, what if we want to know how many keys in our hash are symbols?

```ruby
my_hash = { "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, four: 4 }

my_hash.count { |key, value| key.is_a?(Symbol) }
#=> 1
```

<br/>

### The `sort` method
`sort` is a method that can operate with or without a block being passed to it. By default, it sorts numbers ascending, and strings alphabetically. However, it can also accept a block that tells it to sort according to any rules you would like. Using this ability can take some practice, but it is a powerful tool.

When you pass a block to `sort`, you must pass two parameters, which are the items being compared at a given time. The key is to make the block you pass return a -1 if the order of the items should be swapped and return 1 if they should not be swapped. (Technically, it should also have a return of 0 for when they are equal, but this will rarely actually be necessary.) This is best understood through examples.

In this first example, we want to sort our array of fruits by ascending order of their last letters.

```ruby
my_array = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

my_array.sort do |first, second|
  if first[-1] > second[-1]
    1
  else
    -1
  end
end
#=> ["banana", "apple", "pineapple", "strawberry"]
```

A handy operator is available for this: `<=>`, which is called the 'spaceship' operator. It is used between the two arguments and returns one of three values: 1 if the first arguments is greater, 0 if they are equal, and -1 if the first arguments is less than the second.

Our example above could be re-written as:

```ruby
my_array.sort { |first, second| first[-1] <=> second[-1] }
#=> ["banana", "apple", "pineapple", "strawberry"]
```

And, if we wanted to sort our strings in descending order, we could write the following (just swapping the order of the arguments):

```ruby
my_array.sort { |first, second| second <=> first }
#=> ["strawberry", "pineapple", "banana", "apple"]
```
<br/>

### The `select` method

The `select` method checks every item passed to it against a criteria that you specify, and returns only the items that pass that criteria. Your criteria, as usual, is passed as a block.

Say we want to pick out only the words whose length are greater than 5 characters but less than 10, we would do the following:

```ruby
my_array.select { |word| word.length > 5 && word.length < 10 }
#=> ["banana", "pineapple"]
```
<br/>

### The `find` method
The `find` method is similar to `select`, except it returns only the first item which meets the given criteria. If no such item exists, it returns `nil`. Using the same example as above:

```ruby
my_array.find { |word| word.length > 5 && word.length < 10 }
#=> "banana"
```

`find` is useful if you want to be able to use the results in somewhat advanced conditional logic, since `nil` is falsy while anything returned (other than `false`) would be truthy. Don't worry if you can't quite follow it, but an example would be:

```ruby
word = my_array.find { |word| word.length > 9 && word.length < 10 }
if word
  puts word
else
  puts "No object found"
end
#=> No object found
```
<br/>

### The `map` method
`map` is used to transform each item from the array it is called on and place them into a new array. How the items are transformed is defined by the block you pass to it. `map` may seem confusing at first, but it is extremely useful. Seeing several examples and use cases will help you understand how and when you can use it. You will probably also run into `collect`, which is simply an alias for `map` (same function, different name).

To get the first 20 square numbers, we can simply call `map` on the range of numbers from 1 to 20, like so:
(Ranges are collections too.)

```ruby
my_squares = (1..20).map { |x| x**2 }
#=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400]
```

`map` can be used on strings as well. Here we modify each string in an array by adding an '!':

```ruby
my_strings = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"]
my_emphatic_strings = my_strings.map { |s| s + "!" }
#=> ["One!", "Two!", "Three!", "Four!"]
```

<br/>

### The `reduce` method
`reduce` (alias: `inject`) is possibly the most difficult-to-grasp common method for new coders. The idea is simple enough though: it reduces a collection (array/range/hash) down to a single object. You should use it when you want to get a single value or output from your collection.

A classic example would be a sum or product of an array of numbers. The syntax is where it can be tricky. In most cases, you need to pass a starting 'value' as well as a block with two parameters that tells it how to combine the items. The parameters of the block are the 'cumulative value' and current item.

```ruby
my_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
my_product = my_numbers.reduce(1) { |product, x| product * x }
#=> 3840
```

Here is a more elaborate example, which shows how powerful this method can be. Don't be discouraged if you don't fully understand it at this point. Just know that `reduce` can save you many lines of code in certain scenarios.

Here's an example in which you've been given the task of determining the distribution of names from an array of students by first letter.

```ruby
students = ["Steve", "Robert", "Sarah", "John", "Ryan", "Rebecca", "Jane", "Sanjay", "Randy", "Sam", "Abigail"]

students_by_letter = students.reduce(Hash.new(0)) do |hash, name|
  hash[name[0]] += 1
  hash
end
#=> {"S"=>4, "R"=>4, "J"=>2, "A"=>1}
```

Note that this example returns a hash with several `key => value` pairs. So the object that `reduce` returns is still one object, a hash. It's just a more complex one.

## Conclusion

This introduction to some of the more common enumerable methods should give you an idea of how many tools Ruby puts in your tool box that you are free to utilize in whatever combination you wish. Therefore given a task, and the many tools available, it is common for different coders to come up with different solutions to arrive at the same result.
