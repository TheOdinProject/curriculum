### Numbers
You probably already know what numbers are so there's no need to go into elaborate
metaphors here.

Ruby has all the typical math operators you would expect:

```ruby
# addition
1 + 1 #=> 2

# subtraction
2 - 1 #=> 1

# multiplication
2 * 2 #=> 4

# division
10 / 5 #=> 2

# modulus (find the remainder from division)
8 % 2 #=> 0
10 % 4 #=> 2

# exponent
2 ** 2 #=> 4
3 ** 4 #=> 81
```

#### Integers and Floats
There are two main types of number in Ruby:

**Integers** are whole numbers such as 10.

**Floats** are numbers which have a decimal point such as 10.5.

Here's one of the gotchas to bear in mind when working with integers and floats:

When doing arithmetic with two integers, the result will always be an integer.
Even if you didn't want it to be.

```ruby
17 / 5 #=> 3
```

To solve this problem, just replace one of the integers with a float in the expression.

```ruby
17 / 5.0 #=> 3.4
```

#### Converting Number Types
Ruby makes it very easy to convert numbers to and from floats or integers with a couple of
methods.

```ruby
# converting a float to an integer
13.0.to_i #=> 13

# converting to a integer to a float
13.to_f #=> 13.0
```
When converting from a float to an integer remember that the decimal places will effectively be cut off so only the whole (integer) remains. It won't do any rounding to the closest number.

#### Some Useful Number Methods
There are a lot of very useful methods you can use built into Ruby. A couple quick examples:

**even?**
```ruby
6.even? #=> true
7.even? #=> false
```

**odd?**
```ruby
6.odd? #=> false
7.odd? #=> true
```

### Strings
Strings, strings, wonderful things, use them well and your app will grow wings. Or something.

At first glance, you'd be forgiven for thinking strings are just a bunch of characters that aren't very useful beyond getting user input and outputting some information to the screen, but like Burt Reynolds passing up the chance of playing Han Solo, you'd be wrong. Very wrong. What were you thinking Burt?

From the prep course, you should have a good understanding of strings so we won't bore you to death recapping what you already know. Instead we'll just cover some of the pitfalls and more interesting features and let the reading assignments do the rest.

#### double and single quotes in strings
Strings can be formed with either double `""` or single`''` quotes. They are pretty similar but there are some differences.

#### Interpolation
Use double quotes for string interpolation.

  ```ruby
  name = "Odin"
  puts "Hello, #{name}" #=> "Hello, Odin"
  puts 'Hello, #{name}' #=> "Hello, #{name}"
  ```

#### Concatenation
In true Ruby style, there are plenty of ways to concatenate strings.

```ruby
# with the plus operator
"Welcome " + "to " + "Odin!" #=> "Welcome to Odin!"

# with the shovel operator
"Welcome " << "to " << "Odin!" # "Welcome to Odin!"

# with the concat method
"Welcome ".concat("to ").concat("Odin!") #=> "Welcome to Odin!"
```
Classic Ruby!

#### Common string methods
There are a lot of useful methods you can use that are built into Ruby. Someone needs you to capitalize a word? No problem! Reverse a string? Not all heroes wear capes. Extract the binary subatomic algorithm from any regex grep? Errrrrrrrr, yeah totally.

Just remember, strings have loads of methods provided to you for free and you can find them all in the [Ruby docs](ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/String.html). If you're working with strings and need to do something, check the Ruby Docs first and see if there is one that does it for you.

Below is a quick recap on the more common methods you might find yourself using. Feel free to follow along to these in irb or [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/ruby) to get a feel for them.

**capitalize**
```ruby
"hello".capitalize #=> "Hello"
```

**include?**
```ruby
"hello".include?("lo") #=> true

"hello".include?("z") #=> false
```

**upcase**
```ruby
"hello".upcase #=> "HELLO"
```
**downcase**
```ruby
"Hello".downcase #=> "hello"
```

**empty?**
```ruby
"hello".empty? #=> false

"".empty? #=> true
```

**length**
```ruby
"hello".length #=> 5
```

**reverse**
```ruby
"hello".reverse #=> "olleh"
```

**split**
```ruby
"hello world".split #=> ["hello", "world"]
```
**strip**
```ruby
" hello, world   ".strip  #=> "hello, world"
```

#### Substrings
You can access strings inside strings inside strings. Stringception! It's super easy too.

```ruby
"hello"[0] #=> "h"

"hello"[0..1] #=> "he"

"hello"[0, 4] #=> "hell"

"hello"[-1] #=> "o"

"hello dude"[0,5][1..3] #=> "ell". I have no idea why you'd want to do this, but you can!
```

#### Escape Characters
Hopefully these are self explanatory. Use them if you need them in your code. There may be some gotchas with single quotes so use double quotes to be safe.

```ruby
\\ #=> Need a backslash in your string?
\b #=> Backspace
\r #=> Carriage return, For you oldies that love typewriters
\n #=> Newline. You'll use this one.
\s #=> Space
\t #=> Tab
\" #=> Double Quote
\' #=> Single Quote
```
The best thing to do is play around with them in a Repl.


#### String Manipulation
You'll read about these in the assignments. So I'll just leave some examples to get your creative juices flowing  thinking about some awesome ways to actually modify strings.

```ruby
"he77o".sub("7", "l") #=> "hel7o"

"he77o".gsub("7", "l") #=> "hello"

"hello".insert(-1, " dude") #=> "hello dude"

"hello".split("") #=> ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

"!".prepend("hello ", "world") #=> "hello, world!"
```

The assignments will go deeper and clarify more than I have, so go through them and be sure to play around in a Repl.

#### Converting other objects to strings
Using the `to_s` method, you can convert pretty much anything to a string, here are some examples:

```ruby
5.to_s #=> "5"

nil.to_s #=> ""

:symbol.to_s #=> "symbol"
```

### Symbols

Symbols are an interesting twist on the idea of a string. The real explanation can be a bit long, but here's the short version:

Strings can be changed, so every time a string is used, Ruby has to store it in memory even if an existing string with the same value already exists. Symbols on the other hand are stored in memory once. This makes symbols faster than strings at certain things.

One use for symbols over strings are as keys in hashes. We'll cover this in detail in the hashes lesson later in the course.

You won't need to use symbols much in the beginning, but it's good to get familiar with what they are and what they look like so you can recognise them in Ruby code.

#### Create a Symbol
To create a symbol simply put a colon at the beginning of some text
```
:my_symbol
```



#### Symbols vs Strings
To get a better idea of how symbols are stored in memory, give this a whirl in irb or repl.it.

```ruby
"string" == "string"
  => true
"string".object_id == "string".object_id
  => false
:symbol.object_id == :symbol.object_id
  => true
```


### True, false and nil
You will learn about these data types in more detail in the conditional logic lesson later in this course. Until then it will be beneficial to have a basic understanding of what they are.

#### true and false
These represent exactly what you think. `true` represents something which is true and `false` represents the opposite.

#### nil
Nil represents 'nothing'. Everything in Ruby has a return value. When a piece of code doesn't have anything to return, it will return `nil`. This is pretty abstract but it will make more sense as you learn and use Ruby more in depth.
