### Enumerable Exercises
#### 1. Write a program which prints **each** item in a array to the screen.

Here are some sample arrays to test it:

~~~ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#=> 1
#=> 2
#=> 3
#=> 4
#=> 5
~~~

~~~ruby
['oh', 'no', 'pls', 'stahp', 'undo']

#=> 'oh'
#=> 'no'
#=> 'pls'
#=> 'stahp'
#=> 'undo'
~~~

#### 2. Write a program which multiplies each number in a array by 10 and then returns a new array with the multiplied numbers.

Here are some sample arrays to test it:
`[1, 2, 3, 4] #=> [10, 20, 30, 40]`
`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50] #=> [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]`


#### 3. Write a program which **selects** all the numbers that are less than 10 and returns them in a new array.

Here are some sample arrays to test it:
`[10, 2, 3, 4, 78, 8, 67, 25] #=> [2, 3, 4, 8]`
`[1, 22, 3, 7, 50, 89, 9] #=> [1, 3, 7, 9]`

#### 4. Write a program which returns the sum of all the numbers in a array.

Here are some sample arrays to test it:
`[10, 20, 30, 40] #=> 100`
`[1, 2, 3, 7, 10] #=> 20`

#### 5. Write a program which returns true if a array **includes** 15. Otherwise it should return false.

Here are some sample arrays to test it:
`[10, 15, 30, 40] #=> true`
`[1, 2, 3, 14, 16] #=> false`

#### 6. Write a program which returns true if **all** the elements in a array are greater than 10. Otherwise it should return false.

Here are some sample arrays to test it:
`[10,20,30,40] #=> true`
`[1,2,3,4,5] #=> false`
`[1,10,2,20,3,30] #=> false`

#### 7. Write a program which returns true if **any** numbers are greater than 10 in a array. Otherwise it should return false.

Here are some sample arrays to test it:
`[10,20,30,40] #=> true`
`[2,8,17,89,50,3] #=> true`
`[1,2,3,4,5] #=> false`
