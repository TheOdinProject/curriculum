### Introduction

You've learned about Models, Views, and Controllers.  That's the nuts and bolts, but we've got plenty of neat stuff to cover which makes Rails much more useful to you.  In this lesson, we'll talk about the Asset Pipeline and a few other topics that don't necessarily fit well in other lessons but are important to cover nonetheless.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- How files are processed in the Asset Pipeline.
- Organization of stylesheets and images in your app.
- How to display raw HTML-code in your app.

### The Asset Pipeline

Assets in your application are additional files that get called by the browser after your initial gob of HTML is received. Assets is used to mean things like CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, videos etc... basically anything that requires an additional request to grab it. It used to be that the Asset Pipeline handled all assets, but it is now better practice to handle JavaScript assets through other JavaScript management tools that come with modern Rails applications. For Rails 7, the standard way to add and manage JavaScript is through import maps, which you will learn about in the next lesson. However, if you ever work on legacy applications that use older versions of Rails, you may well find JavaScript is still handled by the Asset Pipeline.

Currently, the Asset Pipeline is one of a few different ways to handle assets in Rails. You will learn about other ways to manage CSS and JS as you move through this course. It may well depend on where you end up working what convention they follow but as you learn more, you'll understand how the Asset Pipeline differs from alternatives as well as how to use any of the available methods to handle assets in your application. Here we will cover how the Asset Pipeline works, and in future lessons we will cover the alternatives. For your own projects we suggest using import maps for JavaScript code and the Asset Pipeline for other assets.

Getting back to the Asset Pipeline, often times, it's easiest to organize your code for development purposes into many different files so you can keep track of them better.  But if the browser has to grab a dozen different CSS files, each one of those requests is going to slow things down.  Too many requests and you've harpooned your user's experience with your application.

A similar organizational issue has to do with storing things like images.  It's easier to keep them separated in your directory but you want them to be really simple to link to so your image tags are robust.

Rails' solution to these problems is to flatten everything out and mash all your asset files together into one big asset for each filetype (called "concatenation").  The process used to do this is the Asset Pipeline.  For your CSS files, this means that Rails will take all the individual `.css` files and just stack them on top of each other in one giant asset file.  It will then run an "uglifier" or "minifier" program on the file to remove extraneous spaces and make everything nice and small for shipping to the browser.

JavaScript files are the same -- all of them get smooshed together and then uglified before being shipped to the browser as one single file.  It's better to have one slightly larger file than to make several full HTTP requests.

#### Manifest Files

The below section on the JavaScript manifest isn't relevant to Rails 7 applications where import maps are used. That will be covered in the import maps lesson but just be aware you may come across this in older Rails projects so get an idea of how it works.

Rails needs to know which files to include in that giant blob, so it uses so-called "manifest" files to determine this.  Your JavaScript manifest file will be `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`.  It looks commented out, but the lines starting with `//=` tell Rails which files to go find and include.  The comments in the file are pretty useful -- they say:

~~~javascript
// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or vendor/assets/javascripts of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
~~~

The `require_tree` helper method just grabs everything in the current directory.

Note that packages like jQuery aren't included out of the box in newer Rails applications. So, if you do end up using the asset pipeline for JavaScript (which you still can for Rails 7 applications), your JavaScript manifest may look a little different.

Your stylesheet manifest file operates on the same principle -- it's available at `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

~~~css
/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS (and SCSS, if configured) file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
 */
~~~

Again, you see the `require_tree` helper method which brings in all CSS files in the current directory. You should put CSS sparingly into this top level file and instead add your own CSS stylesheet files in an organized way.

For example, you can create stylesheets corresponding to each of your Controllers in Rails. So if you create a Controller called `CatController` to handle all those requests for your awesome collection of cat GIFs, then you would also create a `cat.css` stylesheet where you can put CSS related to your cat views. Use `touch` or `echo` on the command line to add the stylesheet: `touch app/assets/stylesheets/cat.css`.

Reading the comments in the stylesheet manifest file above, you can also see that a couple other directories are assumed to be a "local directory" and can be easily referenced as well, like the `lib/assets` and `vendor/assets` files.  Sometimes, if you start using a new gem you manually need to add the new stylesheets and JavaScripts to the manifest files to make sure your application actually includes them in the final output. In a later lesson, you will learn how to use common CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind with Rails applications.

#### The Output

Speaking of final output, what is it?  Well, Rails mashes all the specified files together and creates a new one called something like: `application-1fc71ddbb281c144b2ee4af31cf0e308.js`.  That nonsensical string of characters is meant to differentiate between files if you end up making any changes.  If they were just called something like `application.js`, then your browser would cache it and never know to ask you for the latest version because it's always named the same thing.

But wait, how does the browser know to go looking for `application-1fc71ddbb281c144b2ee4af31cf0e308.js`?  That's what the asset tags we talked about in the previous lesson are useful for.  When you write in your application layout `<%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>`, Rails automatically knows which filename to request to get all your JavaScripts properly imported.

#### Taking This Into Account in Your Code: Namespacing

This sounds great and wonderful and faster for your application, but does it change anything you do?  Oftentimes you can just forget about the manifest files and keep coding along your way.  For your initial applications, you might keep all the styles and JavaScripts in one file anyway, so it's not going to change anything on your end.

It becomes important when, for instance, you have a ton of different pages that likely want to use different stylesheets.  What if you want the `.container` class to do slightly different things in your user login pages versus the checkout pages?  With the asset pipeline, Rails will jam all those files together and you can't be sure which `.container` styles are going to override which others.

In theory, you could override styles from your stylesheets stored at `app/assets/stylesheets` with either inline styles or `<style>` tags, but that gets really messy and totally defeats the purpose of having external stylesheets for keeping code clean.

Let's also assume that you really like using `.container` classes to keep your `<div>` elements neatly organized.  The solution is to use "Namespacing", which means that you basically nest your classes beneath some sort of variable or function name.  This is actually a principle that gets used a LOT, so it's important to understand it.  You'll see it with stylesheets, JavaScripts, modules of code and more.

The basic idea is to be able to say "all this code/css/whatever inside here only belongs to XYZ".  You sort of fence it off.  It's best explained with an example:

~~~html
   <!-- app/views/users/show.html.erb -->
  <div class="user">
    <div class="container">
      <!-- a bunch of code for displaying the user -->
    </div>
  </div>
~~~

Now this container and all the code inside of it is also within the `.user` class.  So we can set up our stylesheet to specifically address the `.container` class that's inside a `.user` class:

~~~css
  /* app/assets/stylesheets/user.css */
  .user .container{
    // style stuff
  }
~~~

This is good because we're now specifically targeting containers used by User pages.

The same principle applies to JavaScript, though we won't cover it here because that's material for a later course.

So anytime you want to make only a portion of your stylesheets or JavaScript code available to a specific set of views, try namespacing it.

#### Rails in Development

The asset pipeline functions a bit differently in development mode.  If you look at your Rails server output when you're working with a webpage in the local environment, it actually sends out a whole bunch of stylesheets and the like.  This is just to give you the ability to debug easier.

#### Images

For images, the asset pipeline keeps them in the `/assets` directory unless you've made your own subdirectories.  Use `image_tag`'s to avoid confusion, e.g. `<%= image_tag "fuzzy_slippers.jpg" %>`.

#### Preprocessors

Remember the preprocessors we talked about in the previous lesson on Views?  Filetypes like ERB and SASS and HAML and Coffeescript all get preprocessed as part of the pipeline.

### Conclusion

The Asset Pipeline isn't something that you often think about, especially when just building little toy apps, but it becomes important to understand as soon as you want to deploy your application (because you'll need to take it into account, which we'll talk about in that lesson later) or work with anything but the vanilla asset structure.
