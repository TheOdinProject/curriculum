### Introduction

Git is like a really **epic save button** for your files and directories. Officially, Git is a version control system.

<span id="text-editor-and-git"></span>A *save* in a text editor records all of the words in a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file, such as `essay.doc`, unless you make duplicate copies (which is difficult to remember to do and keep track of):

`essay-draft1.doc`, `essay-draft2.doc`, `essay-final.doc`

However, a *save* in Git records differences in the files and folders AND keeps a **historical record of each save**. This feature is a game changer. As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub or other alternatives such as: Bitbucket, Beanstalk, or GitLab for sharing and collaborating with other developers. 

Please note, we **only** support GitHub within our curriculum, and will not help troubleshoot the alternatives.

<span id="git-local"></span>While Git works on your *local* machine, <span id="github-remote"></span>GitHub is a *remote* storage facility on the web for all your coding projects. This means that by learning Git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub! This is really important because almost all software development companies consider using Git to be an **essential skill** for modern web developers. Having a GitHub portfolio will provide proof to future potential employers as to what you are capable of.

In this lesson, we will briefly explore the history of Git, what it is, and what it's useful for.

In the next lesson, we will go over the basic workflow for using Git, which should enhance your understanding and demonstrate why Git is so useful.

Finally, you will set up a project with Git that will serve as a template for your future projects.

For now, let's learn what Git is and why it's so powerful!

### Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

 - Explain what Git and GitHub are and the differences between the two.
 - Describe the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping.
 - Describe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

  1. Read Chapter 1.1 through 1.4 in [this book about version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) to learn the differences between local, centralized, and distributed version control systems.
  2. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo) about how Git can improve the workflow of both an individual and a team of developers.
  3. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h9_cB9mPT8&feature=youtu.be&t=13s) for some history on Git and GitHub, and make sure you know the difference between the two. Git is a technology used in the command line while GitHub is a [website](https://github.com/) you can visit.
  4. If you haven't yet installed Git, visit the [Setting Up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/setting-up-git) lesson.
  5. Take a look at The Odin Project's very own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum). This is where all the lessons are stored! While you're there, look at all our [contributors](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/graphs/contributors) to gain an appreciation for how Git records all collaborative efforts and how GitHub visually represents this.
