### Introduction

Hark, young learner, and lend an ear to wisdom's counsel, for you stand now at a momentous threshold.

Indeed, that was no trifling sojourn you have undertaken. Take a moment, if you will, to truly behold the profound truth: you have, by diligence and perseverance, grasped the foundational tenets of no fewer than three tongues. Should necessity demand, you possess the nascent skill to weave together a web page, a rudimentary tapestry of information, with your own hands.

Verily, the arcane art of command lines should now hold less mystery, and the intricate dance that unfolds when a web address is uttered into the browser, culminating in a living page, should no longer be wholly obscure to your understanding. You are now equipped to craft a basic digital parchment and imbue it with simple actions through the subtle magics of JavaScript. And, crucially, a nascent comprehension of how these varied threads intertwine to form the very fabric of your future as a builder of digital realms should now illuminate your mind.

With this newfound lore, you might commence the construction of humble digital outposts. Yet, our purpose here is far grander than mere beginnings. It is our solemn vow to guide you further, to the very precipice where you may, with unwavering confidence, forge web applications of vast scope and formidable might, whether as a lone artisan or as a valued member of a fellowship within a revered technological company.

You have ascended a considerable height upon the winding path of knowledge, yet vast vistas of wonder and intricate skills still await your gaze. Now, the moment of decision draws nigh, a choice of paths stretching before you: that of Ruby with Ruby on Rails, or the journey into JavaScript with Node/Express. Both roads, noble and true, shall illuminate your way, honing your craft, enriching your treasury of projects, and forging you into a developer of renown.

Know this: there is no single, divinely ordained answer as to which path is "best." To master many tongues can render you a developer of broad wisdom, whilst devotion to one may sculpt you into a master of its particular nuances. Both shall lead you to greatness. But I implore you, do not falter nor turn aside halfway through your chosen journey, for such wavering will only cast you back into the shadows of uncertainty.

For to truly learn the ancient art of programming transcends the mere memorization of a language's lexicon. It is to cultivate the mind's eye to seek out the heart of difficult riddles, to forge an engineer's resolve, to navigate the labyrinthine depths of complex code, and to speak with clarity to those who walk alongside you in this grand endeavor, and much, much more. Fortunately, these profound aptitudes are not bound by the confines of a single tongue, but are transferable to all domains of software. And as most languages share a common spirit and structure, to embrace a new one will prove a far less arduous undertaking than your very first.

Arguments, though artfully spun, concerning the tongues most prevalent in your immediate shire may sound compelling. Yet, a truly skilled artisan can wield their craft with ease across different materials. Thus, the initial tongue you master shall not, in truth, fundamentally alter the grand tapestry of your employment. Nevertheless, if a tremor of doubt yet lingers within your heart, then pursue that which grants you peace – even if it entails delving into the local parchment of job scrolls (though overlook not the vast opportunities beyond your immediate borders). Remember, the wisdom gleaned from a noble course far outweighs the initial choice of a specific language.

To aid your contemplation, ponder these merits of each technology...

### Ruby and Ruby on Rails

- Opinionated
  - You don't have to make decisions on the structure of your projects. This helps when moving into projects built by others.
  - You will learn things "The Ruby Way", which can help you write clean code in other languages as well.
- Elegant
  - Brings a lot of tools to help you develop things in a way that makes your code easy to read.
  - Oftentimes solutions in Ruby are much more concise than in other languages.
- Rapid development
  - Rails helps you build applications very quickly. This means you can make a greater number of interesting projects than others in the same time frame.
- Single paradigm
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the Ruby way; many other languages are primarily OOP-based.

### JavaScript - Node & Express

- Un-opinionated
  - There is no standard way of doing things. You are going to have to decide the structure of projects yourself, for better or worse.
- Very fast
  - Because JavaScript utilises JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation, it can do calculations very quickly.
- Verbose
  - There is no magic involved with these technologies. You will have to understand everything to make sense of it.
  - Helps you get closer to how the computer is actually reading your code.
- Same language on both front end and back end
  - Keeping the language consistent can help with writing consistent code across your entire application.
  - Allows you to do some cool things, like writing code that runs on both the browser and the server for optimization purposes.

In the end, it doesn't matter which path you take. It's only important that you stick with it, and continue to hold onto the learner's mindset throughout your career. Not convinced?

Get ready, because this is only the beginning. Now it's time to delve deeper into the areas covered by Foundations. There are some fantastic projects in the courses that follow which will challenge you to the limit, but you'll come out the other side ready to go and make your mark in the programming world.

The journey has just begun!
