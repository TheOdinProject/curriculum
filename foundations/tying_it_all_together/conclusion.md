That was quite a journey.  Take a second and reflect on the fact that you've just learned the basics of at least three different languages and, if you had to, you could probably hack together a web page on your own already.  

You should be fairly comfortable typing commands into your computer's command line and you should understand what happens when you enter a web address into your browser and it returns a page.  You should be able to create a basic web page and make it interactive using JavaScript.  You should understand the purpose of backend code and how frameworks make it easier to get new projects up and running.  Finally, you should have a clear understanding of how all this fits together in your future as a builder of web applications.

With what you know already you could start putting together some basic websites, but we're here to help you get a lot further than that. We want to bring you to the point where you can confidently build a full-featured and scalable web application, either on your own, or working as a developer in a top-tier tech company.  

You've come a long way but there is so much more cool stuff that you'll learn to do. Now is the time to decide which path you want to take going forward. Either Ruby with Ruby on Rails or JavaScript with Node/Express. Both paths will guide you in building skills, building up a portfolio of projects, and becoming a great developer. There is no right answer here on what is the next best path. Both paths will help you become a great developer. The important thing is to not switch halfway though, this will only set you back.

Learning how to program is **much** more than just learning a language. It's about learning how to break down your problems into achievable steps, research and solve difficult problems, communicating effectively with other developers, and much more. Luckily, all these skills are transferrable to other languages and domains of software and because most languages are similar in concept and structure, moving into a different language will be much easier than learning your first.

Arguments about learning the languages used in your area may sound convincing, but because a _good_ developer can transfer skills easily, what you learn isn't going to massively change outcomes of getting a job. Though, if you cannot shake that fear, do whatever you need, even if that includes researching your area to see what jobs are available locally (don't forget about remote jobs though). A good course is far more important than the language you learn first. 

To help you make a decision, here are some perks of each technology:

#### Ruby and Ruby On Rails: 
* Convention over configuration
  - You don't have to make decisions on the structure of your projects.
  - Others' Ruby on Rails code tend to be similarly structured and thus easy to navigate.
* Expressive and flexible syntax
  - Often code can be written in a human-readable style.
* Rapid development
  - Ruby has lots of built-in methods for handling frequently occuring problems so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
  - Ruby on Rails is also "batteries-included". It comes with solutions to common problems already bundled and ready to use.
  - Rails can generate project starter files with its scaffolding generators and CLI commands before you even open your editor.
* Everything is an Object
  - Community embraces a style of programming called "Object Oriented Programming (OOP)", and this concensus further leads to consistency across projects.

#### JavaScript/Node & Express
* Un-opinionated
  - There is no standard way of doing things, you are going to have decide structure of projects yourself, for better or worse.
* Large and Still Growing Community
  - New, innovative tooling and libraries being developed all the time.
  - Lots of new employment opportunities using JS.
* Very fast
  - Node.js is JIT complied, and is consistently one of the fastest dynamic language runtimes in popular benchmarks.
* Same language on both frontend and backend
  - Keeping the language consistent can help with writing consistent code across your entire application.
  - Allows you to do some cool things, like writing code that runs on both the browser and the server for optimization purposes.

In the end, it doesn't matter which path you take, it's only important that you stick with it, and continue to hold onto the learner's mindset throughout your career. Not convinced?

Get ready, because this is only the beginning. Now it's time to dive deeper into the concepts covered in Foundations. There are some fantastic projects in the courses that follow which are designed to challenge you and push your knowledge to the limit. Stick with it and you'll come out the other side ready to make your mark in the programming world.

The journey has just begun!
