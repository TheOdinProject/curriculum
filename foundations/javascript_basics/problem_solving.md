### Introduction

Before we start digging into some pretty nifty JavaScript, we need to begin talking about *problem solving*: the most important skill a developer needs.

Problem solving is the core thing software developers do. The programming languages and tools they use are secondary to this fundamental skill.

V. Anton Spraul defines problem solving in programming as:

> Problem solving is writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints. <br /> - Think Like a Programmer

The set of tasks can range from solving small coding exercises all the way up to building a social network site like Facebook or a search engine like Google. Each problem has its own set of constraints, for example, high performance and scalability may not matter too much in a coding exercise but it will be vital in apps like Google that need to service billions of search queries each day.

New programmers often find problem solving the hardest skill to build. It's not uncommon for budding programmers to breeze through learning syntax and programming concepts, yet when trying to code something on their own, they find themselves staring blankly at their text editor not knowing where to start. 

The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by making lots and lots of programs. The more practice you have the better you'll be prepared to solve real world problems.

In this lesson we will walk through a few techniques that can be used to help with the problem solving process.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

*   Explain the three steps in the problem solving process.
*   Explain what pseudocode is and be able to use it to solve problems.
*   Be able to break a problem down into subproblems.

### Understand the problem
<span id="problem-solving-stages"></span>
The first step to solving a problem is understanding exactly what the problem is.<span id="important-understand-problem"> If you don't understand the problem, you won't know when you've successfully solved it and may waste a lot of time on a wrong solution</span>.

<span id="help-understand-problem">To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps. When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.</span>

### Plan
Now that you know what you're aiming to solve, don't jump into coding just yet. It's time to plan out how you're going to solve it first.
<span id="planning-stage"></span>
Some of the questions you should answer at this stage of the process:

*   Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
*   What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
*   What's the desired output?
*   Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

The last question is where you will write out an algorithm to solve the problem. <span id="algorithm">You can think of an algorithm as a recipe for solving a particular problem. It defines the steps that need to be taken by the computer to solve a problem in pseudocode.</span>

### Pseudocode
<span id="pseudo">Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code. It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will have to go through to solve the problem.</span>

Here's an example of what the pseudocode for a simple program that prints all numbers up to an inputted number might look like:

~~~text
When the user inputs a number
Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one
Print the value of the counter variable
~~~

This is a very simple program to demonstrate how pseudocode looks. There will be more examples of pseudocode included in the assignments.

### Divide and conquer
From your planning, you should have identified some subproblems of the big problem you’re solving. Each of the steps in the algorithm we wrote out in the last section are subproblems. Pick the smallest or simplest one and start there with coding.

It's important to remember that you might not know all the steps that you might need up front, so your algorithm may be incomplete -— this is fine. Getting started with and solving one of the subproblems you have identified in the planning stage often reveals the next subproblem you can work on. Or, if you already know the next subproblem, it’s often simpler with the first subproblem solved.

Many beginners try to solve the big problem in one go. **Don’t do this**. <span id="breaking-problem">If the problem is sufficiently complex, you’ll get yourself tied in knots and make life a lot harder for yourself. Decomposing problems into smaller and easier to solve subproblems is a much better approach. Decomposition is the main way to deal with complexity, making problems easier and more approachable to solve and understand.</span>

In short, break the big problem down and solve each of the smaller problems until you've solved the big problem.

### Solving Fizz Buzz
To demonstrate this workflow in action, let's solve [a common programming exercise: Fizz Buzz, explained in this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

#### Understanding the problem
> Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

This is the big picture problem we will be solving. It's pretty simple so we may not need to reword it. But we can always make it clearer by rewording it.

Write a program that allows the user to enter a number, print each number between one and the number the user entered, but for numbers that divide by 3 without a remainder print `Fizz` instead. For numbers that divide by 5 without a remainder print `Buzz` and finally for numbers that divide by both 3 and 5 without a remainder print `FizzBuzz`.

#### Plan
Does your program have an interface? What will it look like?
Our FizzBuzz solution will be a browser console program, so we don't need an interface. The only user interaction will be allowing users to enter a number.

What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
The user will enter a number from a prompt (popup box).

What's the desired output?
The desired output is a list of numbers from 1 to the number the user entered. But each number that is divisible by 3 will output `Fizz`, each number that is divisible by 5 will output `Buzz` and each number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 will output `FizzBuzz`.

#### Pseudocode
What are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
Here is an algorithm in pseudocode for this problem:

~~~text
When a user inputs a number
Loop from 1 to the entered number
If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise print the current number
~~~

#### Divide and conquer (implement)
As we can see from the algorithm we developed, the first subproblem we can solve is getting input from the user. So let's start there and verify it works by printing the entered number.

With JavaScript, we'll use the "prompt" method.

~~~javascript
let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));
~~~

The above code should create a little popup box that asks the user for a number. The input we get back will be stored in our variable `answer`. **Note**: We wrapped the prompt call in a `parseInt` function so that a number is returned from the user's input.

With that done, let's move on to the next subproblem: "Loop from 1 to the entered number". There are many ways to do this in JavaScript. One of the common ways - that you actually see in many other languages like Java, C++, and Ruby - is with the [for loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for):

~~~javascript
let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
~~~

If you haven't seen this before and it looks strange, it's actually straightforward. We declare a variable `i` and assign it 1: the initial value of the variable `i` in our loop (**NOTE**: Most of the time, programmers find themselves looping from 0. Due to the needs of our program, we're starting from 1). The second clause, `i <= answer` is our condition. We want to loop until `i` is greater than `answer`. The third clause, `i++`, tells our loop to increment `i` by 1 every iteration. As a result, if the user inputs 10, this loop would print numbers 1 - 10 to the console.

With that working, let's move on to the next problem: If the current number is divisible by 3, then print `Fizz`.

~~~javascript
let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
~~~

We are using the modulus operator (`%`) here to divide the current number by three. If you recall from a previous lesson, the modulus operator returns the remainder of a division. So if a remainder of 0 is returned from the division, it means the `current` number is divisible by 3.

After this change the program will now output this when you run it and the user inputs 10:

~~~bash
1
2
Fizz
4
5
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
10
~~~

The program is starting to take shape. The final few subproblems should be easy to solve as the basic structure is in place and they are just different variations of the condition we've already got in place. Let's tackle the next one: If the current number is divisible by 5 then print `Buzz`.

~~~javascript
let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
~~~

When you run the program now, you should see this output if the user inputs 10:

~~~bash
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
~~~

We have one more subproblem to solve to complete the program: If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print `FizzBuzz`.

~~~javascript
let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
~~~

We've had to move the conditionals around a little to get it to work. The first condition now checks if `i` is divisible by 3 and 5 instead of checking if `i` is just divisible by 3. We've had to do this because if we kept it the way it was, it would run the first condition `if (i % 3 === 0)`, so that if `i` was divisible by 3, it would print `Fizz` and then move on to the next number in the iteration, even if `i` was divisible by 5 as well.

With the condition `if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0)` coming first, we check that `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5 before moving on to check if it is divisible by 3 or 5 individually in the `else if` conditions.

The program is now complete! If you run it now you should get this output when the user inputs 20:

~~~bash
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
~~~
