### Introduction
Knowing how to use the Developer Tools inside your browser is an important skill for any web developer. The Developer Tools are useful for running JavaScript code, editing HTML and CSS styles without having to refresh the page, and viewing performance data. They also save you lots of time. Getting started couldn't be any easier. You should already be familiar with using them for debugging and working on HTML and CSS, so let's take a look at how they can benefit us when writing JavaScript.

Google has updated some of the required sections in the below tutorials and some elements have changed or no longer exist, but you can still follow along using the same functionality and tools that they cover. For example, you may be asked to inspect a button that is no longer on the page- you can still follow along and inspect existing elements without issue.

1. Head to the [Chrome DevTools Documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) by Google. The following subsections cover what you'll be using the Developer Tools for 95% of the time.  Feel free to skip the elements you are already familiar with:
