### Introduction

In the previous lesson, we covered basic CSS syntax and selectors. Now, it's time to combine our knowledge of selectors with the *C* of CSS - the cascade.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

*   What the cascade does.
*   Specificity and combining CSS selectors.
*   How inheritance affects certain properties.

### The cascade of CSS

Sometimes we may have rules that conflict with one another, and we end up with some unexpected results. "But I wanted *these* paragraphs to be blue, why are they red like these other paragraphs?!" As frustrating as this can be, it's important to understand that CSS doesn't just *do* things against our wishes. CSS only does what we tell it to do. One exception to this is the default styles that are provided by a browser. These default styles vary from browser to browser, and they are why some elements create a large "gap" between themselves and other elements, or why buttons look the way they do, despite us not writing any CSS rules to style them that way.

So if you end up with some unexpected behavior like this it's either because of these default styles, not understanding how a property works, or not understanding this little thing called the cascade.

The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML. There are different factors that the cascade uses to determine this. We will examine three of these factors, which will hopefully help you avoid those frustrating "I hate CSS" moments.


#### Specificity

A CSS declaration that is more specific will take precedence over less specific ones. Inline styles, which we went over in the previous lesson, have the highest specificity compared to selectors, while each type of selector has its own specificity level that contributes to how specific a declaration is. Other selectors contribute to specificity, but we're focusing only on the ones we've gone over so far:

1. ID selectors (most specific selector)
2. Class selectors
3. Type selectors

Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple, conflicting declarations targeting it, sort of like a tie-breaker. An ID selector will always beat any number of class selectors, <span id="high-specificity-class-type">a class selector will always beat any number of type selectors</span>, and a type selector will always beat any number of anything less specific than it. When no declaration has a selector with a higher specificity, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller amount of that same selector.

Let's take a look at a few quick examples to visualize how specificity works. 
Consider the following HTML and CSS code:

~~~html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list subsection"></div>
</div>
~~~

~~~css
/* rule 1 */
.subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}
~~~

In the example above, both rules are using only class selectors, but rule 2 is more specific because it is using more class selectors, so the `color: red;` declaration would take precedence.

Now, let's change things a little bit:

~~~html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list" id="subsection"></div>
</div>
~~~
~~~css
/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}
~~~

In the example above, despite rule 2 having more class selectors than ID selectors, rule 1 is more specific because ID beats class. In this case, the `color: blue;` declaration would take precedence.

~~~css
/* rule 1 */
#subsection {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main #subsection {
 color: red;
}
~~~

In this final example, both rules are using ID and class selectors, so neither rule is using a more specific selector than the other. The cascade then checks the amounts of each selector type. Both rules only have one ID selector, but rule 2 has more class selectors, so rule 2 has a higher specificity!

While the `color: red` declaration would take precedence, the `background-color: yellow` declaration would still be applied since there's no conflicting declaration for it.

<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">
##### Not everything adds to specificity
When comparing selectors, you may come across special symbols for the universal selector (`*`) as well as combinators (`+`, `~`, `>`, and an empty space). These symbols do not add any specificity in and of themselves.
</div>

~~~css
/* rule 1 */
.class.second-class {
  font-size: 12px;
}

/* rule 2 */
.class .second-class {
  font-size: 24px;
}
~~~

Here both rule 1 and rule 2 have the same specificity. Rule 1 uses a chaining selector (no space) and rule 2 uses a descendant combinator (the empty space). But both rules have two classes and the combinator symbol itself does not add to the specificity.

~~~css
/* rule 1 */
.class.second-class {
  font-size: 12px;
}

/* rule 2 */
.class > .second-class {
  font-size: 24px;
}
~~~

This example shows the same thing. Even though rule 2 is using a child combinator (`>`), this does not change the specificity value. Both rules still have two classes so they have the same specificity values.

~~~css
/* rule 1 */
* {
  color: black;
}

/* rule 2 */
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
~~~

In this example, rule 2 would have higher specificity and the `orange` value would take precedence for this element. Rule 2 uses a type selector, which has the lowest specificity value. But rule 1 uses the universal selector (`*`) which has no specificity value.

#### Inheritance

Inheritance refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element, are inherited by that element's descendants, even if we don't explicitly write a rule for those descendants. Typography based properties (`color`, `font-size`, `font-family`, etc.) are usually inherited, while most other properties aren't.

The exception to this is when directly targeting an element, as this always beats inheritance:

~~~html
<!-- index.html -->

<div id="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
~~~
~~~css
/* styles.css */

#parent {
  color: red;
}

.child {
  color: blue;
}
~~~

Despite the `parent` element having a higher specificity with an ID, the `child` element would have the `color: blue` style applied since that declaration directly targets it, while `color: red` from the parent is only inherited.

#### Rule order

The final factor, the end of the line, the tie-breaker of the tie-breaker. Let's say that after every other factor has been taken into account, there are still multiple conflicting rules targeting an element. How does the cascade determine which rule to apply?

Really simply, actually. Whichever rule was the *last* defined is the winner.

~~~css
/* styles.css */

.alert {
  color: red;
}

.warning {
  color: yellow;
}
~~~

For an element that has both the `alert` and `warning` classes, the cascade would run through every other factor, including inheritance (none here) and specificity (neither rule is more specific than the other). Since the `.warning` rule was the last one defined, and no other factor was able to determine which rule to apply, it's the one that gets applied to the element.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1.  Go back to our [CSS exercises repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) and finish the last exercise `06-cascade-fix`.

2.  Remember the Recipe page you created as practice from the HTML Foundations section? Well, it's rather *plain* looking, isn't it? Let's fix that by adding some CSS to it!

   * How you actually style it is completely open, but you should use the external CSS method (for this practice and moving forward). You should also try to use several of the properties mentioned in the previous lesson (color, background color, typography properties, etc). Take some time to play around with the various properties to get a feel for what they do. For now, don't worry at all about making it look *good*. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to make something to show off on your resume.

   * We haven't covered how to use a custom font for the `font-family` property yet, so for now take a look at [CSS Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_font.asp) for a list of generic font families to use, and [CSS Web Safe Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for a list of fonts that are web safe. Web safe means that these are fonts that are installed on basically every computer or device (but be sure to still include a generic font family as a fallback).
