### Introduction

Whether it be IMDB's top 250 movies or the FBI's most wanted, lists are everywhere on the web and you are going to need one eventually in your webpages.

Luckily, with HTML there are a couple of different types of lists at your disposal.

### Unordered Lists

If you want to have a list of items where the order doesn't matter, like a shopping list of items that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list.

Unordered lists are created using the `<ul>` element, and <span id="li"></span>each item within the list is created using the list item element `<li>`.

Each list item in an unordered list begins with a bullet point:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="powjajd" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

</p>

### Ordered Lists

If you instead want to create a list of items where the order *does* matter, like step-by-step instructions for a recipe, or your top 10 favorite TV shows, then you can use an ordered list.

Ordered lists are created using the `<ol>` element. Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element `<li>`. However, each list item in an ordered list begins with a number instead:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="yLXYvYp" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/yLXYvYp">
  html-ordered-list</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
