### Introduction
Before you can understand how to program the web, you need a more rigorous understanding of the web itself than you likely have now. These concepts provide a more holistic understanding of the ecosystem in which you will be working and will enable you to talk intelligently with other developers about your work.

### Learning Outcomes
At the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

* Describe what the internet is.
* Describe what packets are and how they are used to transfer data.
* Understand the differences between a web page, web server, web browser and search engine.
* Briefly explain what a client is.
* Briefly explain what a server is.
* Explain what IP addresses are.
* Explain what DNS servers are.
