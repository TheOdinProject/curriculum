### Introduction

The Odin Project is an open source community dedicated to providing the best sources of information to take you from zero to a full-stack developer. More information can be found at The Odin Project's [about page](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

In this unit we learn about how the web works and begin to think about the basics of computer and web programming.

Each of the following sections and lessons represents essential background knowledge. Even if you don't intend to become a web developer yourself, this material should help you gain a useful understanding of the moving parts involved in creating and serving content on the web.

We start by getting to know the internet and your own computer. Next, we will work on setting up a development environment and learn about Git and GitHub. We then review the basics of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript before entering the back-end with a brief foray covering the fundamentals of back-end technologies.

By the end of this unit, you should not only understand how the web works, but also be able to identify and distinguish between all the technologies you will use to build your own web applications. You will be able to build a simple web page, style it and add minor elements of interactivity while working comfortably from the command line.

This section intentionally covers a very broad range of topics. It's silly to jump straight into server-side programming without having some context for what it is and why it's useful (and why you should learn it!).

### How It Works

This curriculum works by aggregating the best content from around the web to learn a specific topic. In each lesson we will introduce the topic and try to provide some useful context before referring you to external resources made by others.

Most lessons will include questions that you should be able to answer before moving on. Some of the lessons will ask you to complete exercises. In addition, we offer several projects throughout the curriculum to help you increase your understanding by actually building things.

Try not to think of the Odin project or programming as a class in school. It's not material you learn in one go, take a test, and then pass or fail. You can think of it as a snowball. You are a snowball yourself. You roll down a hill full of snow; the further you roll, the more snow will stick to you. Of course, snow will also fall off you and you will often forget things, but that is just part of the process. Don't be afraid if you get to a project and feel like you haven't retained or memorized anything. It is natural and happens to everyone. The information will come back to you as you start solving your problems one at a time, relying on Google and the Odin community for help.

### A Note About Language

The Odin project attracts people from all over the world who want to learn how to become developers. Please note that this curriculum is written in English and maintained by English speakers who are not able or expected to translate it for you. As you develop into a programmer, you will find that the world you enter is firmly rooted in the English language. This means that the syntax of your programming language, the documentation that teaches you how to use it, and the majority of people in the community all expect to communicate with you in English.

If you are a non-English speaker or English is not a primary language for you, this fact is not meant to deter you, but to prepare you.

As another part of this preparation, we *strongly* recommend spending extra time on topics and terms that you don't immediately understand. We also encourage you to seek additional resources that teach these topics in your own native language so that you can understand them more fully.

In addition to this, you may also consider using a translation dictionary in your own language along with our curriculum so that you can easily refer to it as you go. We have no recommendations on these, as there are so many different languages spoken around the world, finding one might be a good first step in learning how to find useful tools online by searching. This is a skill you will use and improve as you progress in your learning to become a developer.

### What Comes Next

After completing this course, you should feel comfortable with the building blocks of web programming, but you'll want to dig deeper. While we spend quite a bit of time digging into each of the big topics in this course, it's really just a taste of what's coming next (and all the cool things you can do with it).

The final lesson of this course allows you to choose between a Full Stack JavaScript and Full Stack Rails path, both designed
to take the foundation built in this course and build it into an applied understanding of the material. Each path will focus on taking these raw building blocks and honing them into a highly functional skill set.

The Odin project is maintained by professionals. We've selected some of the best resources available and put together a guide on how to review them. If there are no good resources, we write them ourselves. That being said, know that **everything** in the syllabus is deliberately included and essential for you to become a successful programmer.

As you move forward in the curriculum, each section builds on everything that came before it, so skipping things will create pockets of incomprehension in your knowledge that will begin to affect your ability to solve problems and understand the current task.

Additional resources are the only ones considered optional unless explicitly stated. These are here if you feel you need or want to delve deeper into a topic to gain a better understanding.

**DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING!**
