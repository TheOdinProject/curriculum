### Guide: ChromeOS setup

With the recent addition of being able to run a Linux terminal, the ChromeOS platform has been opened up to the ability to install native Linux applications. If you wish to use your Chromebook to complete The Odin Project, you will need to ensure you meet a couple requirements:

1. You have a supported Chromebook:
   - [Official Chromebooks](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux)
   - [ChromeOS Flex Chromebooks](https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094)
1. [Set up Linux on your Chromebook](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en).

Once you have successfully met both of these requirements, you should be able to follow along with the Linux instructions throughout the entire curriculum.
