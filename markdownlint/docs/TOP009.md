# `TOP009`: Lesson overview items sentence structure

Tags: `content`

Aliases: `lesson-overview-items-sentence-structure`

This rule is triggered when a lesson overview item doesn't end with a period `.` or doesn't start with a capital letter. For example:

```markdown
- Lesson overview item 1
- Lesson overview item 2?
- lesson overview item 3.
```

To fix this issue, make sure that each bullet point ends with a period `.` and starts with a capital letter, rewording if you need to fix grammar since these should not be questions.

```markdown
- Lesson overview item 1.
- Lesson overview item 2.
- Lesson overview item 3.
```

## Rationale

Lesson overview items should follow a consistent structure. They must tell the user what the lesson is about via brief overview statements, and must not be conveyed in the form of a question that the user is expected to be able to answer after completing the lesson.
