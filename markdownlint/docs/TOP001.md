# `TOP001` - Descriptive link text

Tags: `accessibility`, `links`

Aliases: `descriptive-link-text`

This rule is triggered when a link has a text label that uses the words "this" or "here", for example:

```markdown
You can read more about variables in JavaScript [here](https://example.com).
[This article](https://example.com) provides more information about closures.
```

To fix this issue, remove the words "here" and "this" and use more descriptive text that clearly conveys the purpose or content of the link. You may need to also update the surrounding text. The following code block demonstrates how the links from above could be fixed:

```markdown
You can read more about [variables in JavaScript](https://example.com).
[An in-depth article about closures in JavaScript](https://example.com) provides more information.
```

Note that this rule only flags text labels containing the words "this" or "here", even if the text is somewhat descriptive:

```markdown
[Here is a comprehensive guide to understanding closures](https://example.com).
```

In this case, it's still better to rephrase the link text to be more concise and descriptive:

```markdown
[Comprehensive guide to understanding closures](https://example.com)
```

Additionally, consider including relevant keywords in the link text to provide more context:

```markdown
For more information, refer to the [official documentation on closures in JavaScript](https://example.com).
```

## Rationale

 Descriptive link text improves accessibility by providing clear and meaningful context about the link's destination. Links with text labels using the words "this" or "here" tend to be less descriptive and may not effectively convey the purpose of the link to users, especially those using assistive technologies. By using specific and relevant keywords in the link text, you can enhance the user experience and make it easier for users to understand the context and purpose of the link.
