# `TOP011`: Dashes in headings

Tags: `headings`

Aliases: `dashes-in-headings`

This rule is triggered when a heading contains dashes used for separating the heading's main title from a subtitle. For example:

```markdown
### Headings - Should dashes be used as separators?

### Headings -- Should double dashes be used as separators?
```

Instead of the dash(es), use a colon instead.

```markdown
### Headings: Colons must be used as separators
```

This rule only triggers for dashes used in this way. Dashes used as hyphens or CLI flags will not trigger this rule.

```markdown
### Hyphenated-words are perfectly acceptable

### As are headings with CLI -f --flags
```

Headings that violate this rule can be fixed via the appropriate `fix:*` script.

```markdown
### Headings - Hyphenated-words and --flags will be left alone

<!-- Will get fixed to -->
### Headings: Hyphenated-words and --flags will be left alone
```

## Rationale

Markdownlint and Visual Studio Code use the [GitHub heading algorithm](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-pipeline/blob/f13a1534cb650ba17af400d1acd3a22c28004c09/lib/html/pipeline/toc_filter.rb) to generate the appropriate fragments from headings, which preserves *all* dashes in the heading. The TOP web app uses the [Ruby on Rails `#parameterize` method](https://apidock.com/rails/String/parameterize) to generate heading IDs and fragments, which removes separator dashes.

For example, the heading `### Heading - Hyphenated-subheading` will be converted to `heading---hyphenated-subheading` by Visual Studio Code and Markdownlint, but our web app will convert it to `heading-hypenated-subheading`.

This creates a discrepancy between the fragment any of our links would require for our website, and what Markdownlint considers "valid". Using the website-valid fragment would trigger Markdownlint's [MD051 rule](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/md051.md). Using the Markdownlint-valid fragment would not match the right heading on our website.

Enforcing colons instead of dashes as separators, we can also avoid messy heading ID syntax such as `### Heading - Hyphenated-subheading {#heading-hypenated-subheading}`. Heading ID syntax would also introduce an additional point of failure, since we might change the heading and forget to change the custom ID.
