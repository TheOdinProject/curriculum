# `TOP011` - Note box heading level

Tags: `headings`

Aliases: `note-box-heading-level`

This rule is triggered when a [note box](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/LAYOUT_STYLE_GUIDE.md#note-boxes) has its heading not set at level 4, which is required by our layout style guide.

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

### Non-level 4 note box heading: Will flag a TOP011 error as it should be level 4

Note box contents.

</div>
```

This can be resolved by changing the note box heading to a level 4 heading:

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

#### Level 4 note box heading: Correct and will not flag a TOP011 error

Note box contents.

</div>
```

This error is fixable with our `fix:*` npm scripts, which will convert the heading to be at level 4.

## Rationale

Consistent use of heading levels for note boxes looks better on the website, and is less confusion as note boxes are not main sections themselves, so should not use a level 3 heading.

The website also uses specific CSS for when note box headings are hovered over. Having non-level 4 headings in these note boxes causes behaviour inconsistent with what we expect.
