# `TOP008` - Lesson overview items sentence structure

Tags: `content`, `language`

Aliases: `lesson-overview-items-sentence-structure`

This rule is triggered when a lesson overview item doesn't end with a period `.` or doesn't start with a capital letter. For example:

```markdown
- Lesson overview item 1
- Lesson overview item 2?
- lesson overview item 3.
```

To fix this issue, make sure that each bullet point ends with a period `.` and starts with a capital letter.

```markdown
- Lesson overview item 1.
- Lesson overview item 2.
- Lesson overview item 3.
```

## Rationale

Make sure lesson overview items follow a consistent structure. Lesson overview items should be brief overviews of what the lesson is about, they should not be questions.
