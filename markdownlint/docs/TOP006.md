# `TOP006` - Use full language name for fenced code blocks

Tags: `code`, `language`

Aliases: `full-fenced-code-language`

The rule is triggered when a language is specified for a fenced code block that uses a valid abbreviated name instead of the full language name.

In this repo, the expected languages for this to affect are:

- `js` => `javascript`
- `rb` => `ruby`
- `md` => `markdown`
- `txt` => `text`
- `sh` => `bash`
- `yml` => `yaml`

Other languages that have abbreviated names, such as HTML and CSS, are not affected by this rule, as only the abbreviated forms are valid options.

## Rationale

Alongside other rules such as code block delimiters, list styles, and blank lines, the purpose of this rule is to enforce consistency within and between our files.
