# `TOP003` - Default section content

Tags: `content`

Aliases: `default-section-content`

This rule is triggered when a section does not have the expected default content or structure. The affected sections include:

- Lesson Overview
- Assignment
- Knowledge Check
- Additional Resources

## Contains content before or after list

There should be no content before or after the unordered list of items in the "Lesson overview", "Knowledge check", and "Additional resources" sections, other than the default content.

Incorrect (content after the list):

```markdown
### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- LO item

Some additional content
```

Incorrect (content before the list):

```markdown
### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

Some additional content

- LO item
```

Correct:

```markdown
### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- LO item
```

## Contains incorrect default content

Each section should contain the correct default content.

Incorrect (wrong default content before the list):

```markdown
### Lesson Overview

This section has the incorrect text following the heading.

- LO item
```

Correct:

```markdown
### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- LO item
```

Incorrect (missing the list after the `Additional Resources` heading):

```markdown
### Additional Resources

```

Correct:

```markdown

```

Incorrect (contains a nested list):

```markdown

  - A nested item
```

Correct:

```

## Missing "Assignment" section div wrapper

The "Assignment" section should contain a div with the correct attributes. Note that not all assignment content needs to be wrapped in this div, but it must at least exist in this section.

Incorrect (missing the div wrapper with the correct attributes):

```markdown
### Assignment

Assignment content

```

Correct:

```markdown
### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

Assignment content

</div>
```

## Rationale

Including default content in specific sections helps maintain consistency across lessons and provides learners with clear expectations. It also ensures that essential information is not overlooked and that the curriculum structure remains organized and easy to navigate.
