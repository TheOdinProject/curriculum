# `TOP010` - Use lazy numbering within ordered lists

Tags: `ol`

Aliases: `lazy-numbering-for-ordered-lists`

This rule is triggered when lazy-numbering is not used in ordered lists. Specifically we only want `1.` and not other numbers.

```markdown
1. ONE
2. TWO
   1. child one
   2. child two
3. THREE

Running a fix:* script will fix the above example.

1. ONE
1. TWO
   1. child one
   1. child two
1. THREE
```

## Rationale

Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.

Markdown lint's [MD029 rule](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/md029.md) already covers this check, but does not include fix information, therefore can only be used to raise errors for manual fixing. This custom rule enforces the same style but includes fix information that can be used alongside our fix scripts.
