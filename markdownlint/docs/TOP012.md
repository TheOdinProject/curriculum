# TOP012 - Note box headings

Tags: `headings`

Aliases: `note-box-headings`

Fixable via script: The `fix` script can fix incorrect heading levels but of course cannot add missing headings or rename blacklisted headings.

This rule is triggered when a [note box](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/LAYOUT_STYLE_GUIDE.md#note-boxes) does not open with a level 4 (####) heading, which is required by our layout style guide. It will also trigger if the heading text is on our blacklist of commonly used but insufficiently descriptive headings.

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

No heading will flag a TOP012 error.

</div>
```

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

### Non-level 4 note box heading: Will flag a TOP012 error as it should be level 4

Note box contents.

</div>
```

These can be resolved either by adding a level 4 heading or changing the note box heading to a level 4:

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

#### Level 4 note box heading: Correct and will not flag a TOP012 error

Note box contents.

</div>
```

Some commonly used headings are insufficiently descriptive and accessible, and so are blacklisted and will raise a TOP012 error, even if the heading level is correct:

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

#### Note

"Note" on its own is not sufficiently descriptive, which is not accessible enough for users navigating by headings.

It also poses problems if multiple note boxes on the same page have the same heading, both for navigation and for links, as heading links will only ever go to the first instance.

</div>

```

If the error is about the heading level, it is fixable with our `fix:*` npm scripts, which will convert the heading to be at level 4. The `fix:*` script cannot do anything about missing or blacklisted headings.

## Rationale

Headings have IDs that can be linked to. Given the nature of note boxes, enforcing headings for them allows all of them to be more easily linked and navigable to, while the heading also summarizes the note's intent for accessibility. Therefore, they must also be unique.

Consistent use of heading levels for note boxes also looks better on the website, and is less confusing as note boxes are not main sections themselves, so they should not use a level 3 heading.

The website also uses specific CSS for when note box headings are hovered over. Having non-level 4 headings in these note boxes causes behavior inconsistent with what we expect.
