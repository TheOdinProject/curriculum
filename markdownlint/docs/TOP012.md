# TOP012 - Note box headings

Tags: `headings`

Aliases: `note-box-headings`

Fixable via script: The `fix` script can fix incorrect heading levels but of course cannot add missing headings.

This rule is triggered when a [note box](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/LAYOUT_STYLE_GUIDE.md#note-boxes) either does not have a heading or has a heading but it is not a level 4 (####) heading, which is required by our layout style guide.

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

No heading will flag a TOP012 error.

</div>
```

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

### Non-level 4 note box heading: Will flag a TOP012 error as it should be level 4

Note box contents.

</div>
```

These can be resolved either by adding a level 4 heading or changing the note box heading to a level 4:

```markdown
<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

#### Level 4 note box heading: Correct and will not flag a TOP012 error

Note box contents.

</div>
```

If the error is about the heading level, it is fixable with our `fix` npm script, which will convert the heading to be at level 4. The `fix` script cannot do anything about missing headings.

## Rationale

Headings have IDs that can be linked to. Given the nature of note boxes, enforcing headings for them allows all of them to be more easily linked, while the heading also summarizes the note's intent.

Consistent use of heading levels for note boxes also looks better on the website, and is less confusing as note boxes are not main sections themselves, so they should not use a level 3 heading.

The website also uses specific CSS for when note box headings are hovered over. Having non-level 4 headings in these note boxes causes behavior inconsistent with what we expect.
