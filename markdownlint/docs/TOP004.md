# `TOP004` - Lesson headings

Tags: `headings`

Aliases: `lesson-headings`

The rule is triggered when the headings in the document do not match the specified list of required headings. It compares each heading in the document with the corresponding required heading and reports any mismatches.

Currently, the required headings depend on the content's type:

## Lesson headings structure

```markdown
### Introduction
### Lesson Overview
### A Custom Heading
* (Wildcard: Any heading at the same or lower level)
### Assignment
#### * (Wildcard: Any subheading at the h4 level)
### Knowledge Check
### Additional Resources
```

The wildcard symbol * represents any heading text at the specified level. This means that any heading at the specified level will be considered valid, regardless of its actual text content.

## Project headings structure

```markdown
### Introduction
* (Wildcard: Any heading at the same level or lower level)
### Assignment
* (Wildcard: Any heading at the same level or lower level)
```

Similar to the lesson headings structure, the wildcard symbol * in the project headings structure allows for any heading text at the specified level.

## Rationale

Enforcing a consistent heading structure improves readability, organization, and navigation. By specifying a required heading structure, authors can ensure that their documents follow a standardized format and include all the necessary sections. This rule helps maintain consistency across multiple documents and makes it easier for readers to locate specific information.
