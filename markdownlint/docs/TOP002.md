# `TOP002` - No inline code in headings

Tags: `headings`

Aliases: `no-code-headings`

This rule is triggered when a heading contains inline code. For example:

```markdown
## Using `console.log()` for Debugging
```

To fix this issue, remove the inline code from the heading and rephrase it to convey the same meaning without using code:

```markdown
## Using console.log for Debugging
```

## Rationale

Headings should be concise and descriptive, providing a clear overview of the section's content. Including inline code in headings can make them less readable and may not effectively convey the purpose of the section to users.
