### Introduction

Programmers, the best of whom are pretty lazy folk (in a good way), got tired of having to write the same code over and over and over again just to cover the basic tasks that they wanted their applications to perform.  So they batched that recycled code together and called it a framework.

In addition to preventing repetition, frameworks provide great organization.  They tend to force you to organize your files and code in a way that keeps it highly modular and really clean.  When you start a new app with any framework, you're given dozens of folders already organized in a hierarchy which makes sense and follows good practice such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) separation principles.  It's not quite "color-by-numbers" for code, but it certainly keeps things ordered.

There are often several different popular frameworks for a given language.  They can have exciting names like [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), etc.  Wikipedia has a [comprehensive comparison of frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks) that should give you an appreciation of the number of them.  For Ruby alone, though Rails is the most popular, there are also [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/) and more.
