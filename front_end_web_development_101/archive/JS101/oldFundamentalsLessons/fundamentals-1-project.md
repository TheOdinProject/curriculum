# Let's practice.

Now it's time to slow down a little bit with the information overload and practice some of the things you've been learning.  It is perfectly okay if you don't remember how to do any or all of it as you go.. in fact that is to be expected at this point!  When you encounter something you can't remember, just go back to the previous lessons and look it up.  If you get stuck, drop by the chatrooms and ask for help.  Try not to get frustrated and be patient.

## Your assignment

To give you a good bit of practice, we have created an online classroom on repl.it.  In general we believe that it's best to work on programming on your _own_ computer rather than in an online environment.. but we'll get to that soon enough.

The classroom and lessons can be found [here](https://repl.it/community/classrooms/34425). Do the lessons in order.  You do not have to sign up or login to repl.it to do the course, but doing so makes the user experience a little nicer.. you can submit your answers to check them and see 'model solutions' on a couple of the lessons.
