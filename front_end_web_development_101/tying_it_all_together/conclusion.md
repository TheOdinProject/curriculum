That was quite a journey.  Take a second and reflect on the fact that you've just learned the basics of a few different languages and, if you had to, you could probably hack together a web page on your own already.  

You should be fairly comfortable typing commands into your computer's command line and you should understand what happens when you enter a web address into your browser and it returns a functioning page.  You should be able to create a basic web page and make it do some basic things with JavaScript.

With what you know already, you could start putting together some basic websites or strike out to increase your knowledge on your own.  But we're here to help you get a lot further than that, to the point where you can confidently build a web application, whether on your own or working as a developer in a top-tier tech company.  

You've come a long way up the learning curve but there is so much more cool stuff that you'll learn to do!

The journey has just begun!
