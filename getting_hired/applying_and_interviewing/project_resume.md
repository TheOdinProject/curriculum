### Introduction

The goal of a resume is to show the recruiter/hiring manager that you meet the minimum qualifications for the role in which you are applying for. From there, it's on you to speak intelligently and confidently about the things you've done. So don't treat the resume as the catch-all repository of your whole life -- it's more a document that gives the recruiter/hiring manager confidence that you meet the qualifications for the role that they are hiring for.

### Research And Creating A Plan

Before you begin writing all of your achievements and projects down, we strongly encourage you look around on LinkedIn or Glassdoor and see what some of the keywords are for the position you're interested in. These keywords or buzzwords as they sometimes are referred to are what recruiters and hiring managers will be looking for, the catch here is that you shouldn't just litter your resume with keywords. You need to place them in areas where they make sense, you also need to avoid repeating the same keywords in multiple bullet points. Your goal is to try and get between 60-70% of the keywords seen by the recruiter/hiring manager within 20 seconds.

As an example if you are applying for a frontend developer position you will likely see keywords like `HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, APIs etc.`. So when writing out your bullet points you should keep this in mind. Having something that reads like: `Crafted a responsive Weather App using HTML and CSS that connected to external RESTful APIs using JavaScript to give real time weather information to the end user.` When the recruiter/hiring manager is looking over your resume they will be able to pick out those keywords quickly, then if they come back to make sure you didn't just put down some keywords they will see the what, why, and how you were able to build something with that technology.

Recently a trend has emerged where skill sections are used everywhere, either on GitHub pages, Resumes, portfolios, etc. While these may seem useful in the moment, they are anything but. From a hiring manager or a recruiters perspective they are all but useless, they want to know whether you actually understand the technologies listed.

### Resume Building Tips

When crafting your resume you will likely be going through different iterations. You may also be crafting multiple resumes to send out to different positions, for example like we discussed earlier, you may have a resume that is tailored and using keywords that focus more on a frontend position. Another that uses keywords, projects, and other information that is more backend focused. There is nothing wrong with having different resumes for different positions, it helps the hiring manager/recruiter to quickly identify the keywords that align with that position which will give you a higher chance of being successful in your job search. Another thing to keep in mind is that your resume is not supposed to win any sort of awards. Its purpose is to tell the recruiter or hiring manager that you are qualified for the position in which you are applying and to hopefully give them the confidence that you can come in and hit the ground running instead of holding yourself and the company back from progressing.

One misconception is that you need to keep your resume one page, while in most scenarios it's easier to read and visually more appealing to have a one page resume it's not the end of the world if you have to go past one page. Just know that most recruiters or hiring managers may not make it to your second page. So keep as many of the relevant keywords, experience, education, and projects near the top of the first page.

Within the assignment section we linked to a great resume guide written from an active recruiter who has years of experience on what other recruiters and hiring managers are personally looking for when they review a resume. Use it and apply it, you've worked this hard to get this far don't sell yourself short by using a lazy resume.

### Do Not Get Discouraged

The hiring manager will determine if you meet the minimum qualifications of the job listing in less than 20 seconds. At first glance, they will look for your education level if you have one, who's hired you before, and if you've got any really interesting projects that stand out.  The hiring manager rapidly builds a checklist to see if you meet the qualifications of the job listing you've applied for. If you managed to meet those minimum requirements along with some other factors you may receive a call to continue forward in the hiring process. Do not be discouraged if you don't however, there are multiple factors to account for when it comes to whether or not you are selected to move on or not. The best thing to keep in mind is that you continue to grow and build projects and try and gain any relevant experience in the position you're applying for. Remember to keep looking at those keywords and see where you are lacking and then go out and learn and build projects using those technologies.

Knowing that perspective, how can you play to it?  It's difficult if you're breaking into a new industry so you'll need to emphasize relevant education, work experience and projects in a way that crafts a story of drive and capability.  What have you done that shows you're highly capable (e.g., your technical chops, any recognition you've received, leadership of teams)? And can get shit done (e.g. interesting projects, open source contributions)?
