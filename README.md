# Welcome to The Odin Project Curriculum: 

test new branches what
The Odin Project (also known as TOP), is an open-source community for learning full-stack web development. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive curriculum to learn web development for free. We help our students to learn the skills and build the impressive portfolio of projects they need to get hired as a web developer.

The curriculum is divided into distinct courses each covering the subject language in-depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give students the opportunity to practise what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the student's portfolio.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repository houses the curricular content used in [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) website. (cf. [this repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject) which houses the front-end and back-end code.)

The TOP community can be found in our [gitter chat rooms](https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

## Contributing

The Odin Project depends on open-source contributions to improve, grow and thrive. We welcome contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds to help maintain this awesome curriculum and community.
