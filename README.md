# The Odin Project Curriculum: [Learn Web Development for Free](http://theodinproject.com)

This repository houses the curriculum used by [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com).  It is available for free to anyone who would like to learn web development in a project-focused and collaborative environment.\*  

**See it live at [theodinproject.com/curriculum](http://theodinproject.com/curriculum).**

Students, educators, and developers are encouraged to make contributions to the curriculum.  It has been greatly simplified so that should be a rather straightforward process -- just fork this repository, make your changes (e.g. adding the link to your solution for one of the exercises), then submit a pull request.  The lessons presented at [theodinproject.com/curriculum](http://theodinproject.com/curriculum) are all stored in their appropriate course directories here.
