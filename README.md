### Introduction

The Odin Project Curriculum

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. Our curriculum is divided into distinct courses, each covering the subject language in depth. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give users the opportunity to practice what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the user's portfolio.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repo contains the actual lesson files used on our website. For the actual TOP app that pulls in this lesson content and contains our front-end and back-end code, please go to the [main TOP repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

Our community can be found on the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB).

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Understand what The Odin Project is.
- Learn how the curriculum is structured.
- Discover how to contribute to the project.

### Assignment

Let's say you want to contribute to our curriculum repo.

How do you contribute when you do not have write access to the repository? Below is a production-ready workflow that is actually used by contributors to this website. We'll assume here that you have commented on an open issue on our repo and that it has been assigned to you. If you don't have an issue assigned to you, you can still follow along with some arbitrary updates, just stop before step 3 in the Sending your pull request section since your changes aren't legitimate.

The key players in this story will be the upstream (the original GitHub repository), the origin (your fork of that repo), and the "local" repository (your local clone of origin). Think of it as a happy triangle... except that "local" can only pull from upstream, not push, as illustrated in the workflow diagram above.

### Contributing

The Odin Project depends on open-source contributions to improve, grow, and thrive. We welcome contributors of all experience levels and backgrounds to help maintain this awesome curriculum and community.
