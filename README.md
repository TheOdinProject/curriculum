# The Odin Project Curriculum

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) 
The Odin Project (TOP) is an open-source curriculum designed for learning full-stack web development. It offers a series of courses, each focusing deeply on a specific language or technology. Every course includes lessons and hands-on projects that allow learners to practice their skills and reinforce their understanding. Completed projects can be added to the learner’s portfolio, helping showcase their work.

Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!

This repo contains the actual lesson files used on our website. For the actual TOP app that pulls in this lesson content and contains our front-end and back-end code, please go to the [main TOP repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

Our community can be found on the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB).
