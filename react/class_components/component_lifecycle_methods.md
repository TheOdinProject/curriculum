### Introduction

In the previous section, you've dealt with the component lifecycle through the useEffect function. This is how you've run code based on a components lifecycle stage so far, but in class components we have to use specific lifecycle methods instead. In this lesson, we are going to cover said methods.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

*   What the different lifecycle methods are.
*   How we can use these lifecycle methods in our app.

### Render
The render function is the most used lifecycle method, and one that you've come across in the last class components lesson. It is the only required lifecycle method in a class component. It runs on mount and update of a component. Render should be pure, meaning it doesn't modify component state, returns the same thing each time it's called (given the same inputs), and doesn't directly interact with the browser.
