### The What's And Why's

In your previous lessons, you have already been introduced to functional components, and the basic patterns in which components get written now a days. However, React components did not look this way since React was introduced.

If you look into any older React codebase, you'll notice a lot of classes. These are known as class-based components. Prior to February 2019, functional components were also called state-less, as there was no way to manage state in them. This was changed when hooks were introduced, leading to less verbose and 'neater' components.

In your career, chances are, you will be dealing with legacy code, so there will be days where you would be dealing with class components. To meet this issue, we take a peek into the works and intricacies of a class-based component, and how they work.
