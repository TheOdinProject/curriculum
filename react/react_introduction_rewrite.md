### Introduction

This lesson will provide you with information on what React is, its brief history, and why we're choosing to cover it in our curriculum.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Understand the differences between a Javascript Library and Framework
- Understand the benefits of learning React
- Understand what is react

### What Is React?

React according to their <a href="https://reactjs.org/"> official website </a> is "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces" however lets break this down a bit further.

Generally speaking, a JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written code that's designed to make development easier, not to be confused with frameworks however as you'll be reading the differences later on in the lesson. This code can be reused/reimplemented in our own codebases to achieve complex tasks. 

Similarly, React provides powerful primitives (built-in functions/modules) that allows us to build user interfaces of varying complexities. Throughout this course, we'll learn all about the functionality React provides and learn to build cool applications. 

### Why Cover React?

React is one of the most powerful, widely used frontend frameworks.

The landscape for frontend frameworks has been changing a lot over the last few years, so it is understandable to be worried about choosing the "wrong" one.
[This article on the lifecycle of JavaScript frameworks](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/) shows the recent development of frontend frameworks well. Once you start diving deeper into a framework, you will begin to love it. It makes your code easily scalable, more readable, and possibly a thousand times more efficient (just our modest estimation).

Just to name a few reasons on why to learn React:

- Reusability of components
- Well supported due to its popularity
- React is not opinionated, which means that it won't force you to follow any specific design patterns, project organizational structure, or logic. It's all up to you.
- Smaller learning curve, especially when you already have a good grasp of JavaScript and HTML from our previous lessons.

If you need more convincing, the recent [2022 StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks-and-technologies) should be reason enough to get excited about learning React. Still unsure? Check out [this article on why you should learn React](https://laptrinhx.com/top-10-reasons-why-you-should-learn-react-right-now-3718263995/).

_Convinced and excited? Great, because it's going to change your life! Let's dive right into it._

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1.  If you haven't already, browse through the <a href="https://reactjs.org/"> React Website </a>. Don't go too indepth and dive into documentation however do read the introduction/homepage to gage an idea of how React works.

2.  Read this <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/"> FreeCodeCamp article </a> discussing the differences between a Javascript Library and a Framework

3.  Lastly, skim this <a href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/reasons-to-choose-reactjs-for-your-web-development-project.html">in-depth article</a> which explains the major benefits of using React.
