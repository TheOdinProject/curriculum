### Introduction

You have probably heard about reducers before. In this lesson we are going to
learn _what_ they are, _when_ to use them and _how_ to use them in React with the `useReducer` hook.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

* What are reducers.
* When to use reducers.
* What is the `useReducer` hook.

### What are reducers?

Reducers are pure functions that take a previous state and an action to return a new state.

The action is an object with a _type_ property describing what the user did. This object can also contain
any other properties that our reducer might need to produce the new state.

We can define a reducer that updates the state of a counter like this:

~~~js
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
      case 'incremented_count': {
        return { count: state.count + 1 }
        }
      case 'decremented_count': {
          return { count: state.count - 1 }
        }
      case 'set_count': {
          return { count: action.value }
        }
      default: {
          throw error('unknown action: ' + action.type);
        }
    }
}
~~~

Remember, reducers are pure functions so we shouldn't mutate the state.

### When to use reducers?

If a component only needs to update its state in a couple of simple ways, you don't need to use reducers.
The opposite can be said when a component has become too big, hard to read or debug because of its state logic.

By using reducers, we can separate the state logic and even store it in a different file or directory, leading
to smaller components that are easier to read.

Since reducers use _actions_, we can easily track any state-related bugs back to the dispatched action,
and because our reducers are just pure functions, we can test them in isolation.

### The useReducer hook

React allows us to use reducers in our components through a hook called `useReducer`. This hook takes a reducer function and
an initial state as arguments, then returns an array with two values: the current state and a `dispatch` function.

This `dispatch` function receives an **action** object as argument, which is passed to our reducer function and
the returned value from it is used to update the state.

~~~js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_count' });
}
~~~

Similarly to the `set` function in `useState`, React _only updates the state in the next render_ after calling the `dispatch` function.
Keep in mind that these functions use [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) to determine if the state has changed, if it hasn't, then the component won't re-render.

Whether you use `useState` or `useReducer` is up to you, they're both equivalent and you might use them both in the same component.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Read through the React docs [Extracting state logic into a reducer](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) to learn more
about how to use reducers in React and how to refactor `useState` into `useReducer`. Don't forget to complete the challenges at the end.

2. Read the [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) React docs to learn more about this hook. Pay close attention to the
[troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer#troubleshooting) section for common problems that you might encounter.
