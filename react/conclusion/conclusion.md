### Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

Woohoo, React has been conquered! You are officially a React guru. Take a moment to appreciate what you've learned throughout this course and give yourself a round of applause. With React under your tool belt, you are well-equipped to tackle complex projects confidently.

However, your React learning (or learning in general) doesnâ€™t stop here. As proponents of a growth mindset, we believe thereâ€™s so much more to explore and learn.

### Whatâ€™s next

Frontend is the land of innovation, and React is one of the leaders in the space. You can keep up with the future of React by following the [React RFC GitHub repository](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs). This is where new features and changes to React are proposed, discussed, and eventually accepted or rejected. One of the groundbreaking RFCs is [Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-components.md). Over this course, we've rendered our React components in the client, but here this RFC discusses how we can bring React to the server and render it there. This feature has huge potential and is worth keeping an eye on in the future.

Furthermore, you can dive into React meta frameworks. They're a framework for React that add first-class support for functionalities like data fetching and routing. Additionally, they leverage React's latest features to provide the best experience possible for developers and users alike. Some examples of these are [Next](https://nextjs.org/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/).

You're at a point in your React journey where you can begin learning about design patterns and architecture. [patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/) is an exceptional resource that will help you build better React apps by leveraging powerful patterns. They are worth a bookmark!

### Contribute

The Odin Project wouldnâ€™t exist if not for contributors sharing their precious time and resources. We'd love to hear your ideas and suggestions to improve the React course. You can share your thoughts over on our Discord or better yet, open an issue on the [The Odin Project's curriculum repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/issues).

Good luck and happy learning!
