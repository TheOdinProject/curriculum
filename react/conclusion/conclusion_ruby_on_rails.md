### Introduction

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, React has been conquered! You are officially a React guru. Take a moment to appreciate what you've learned throughout this course and give yourself a round of applause. With React under your tool belt, you are well-equipped to tackle complex projects confidently.

However, your React learning (or learning in general) doesnâ€™t stop here. As proponents of a growth mindset, we believe thereâ€™s so much more to explore and learn.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Find out what next steps you should take.

### Whatâ€™s next

You may be interested in learning about React metaframeworks which build on top of React to allow developers to make full use of React's latest features such as server components, as well as providing first class support for things like routing and data fetching, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=navbar).

You can also keep up with the future of React by following the [React RFC GitHub repository](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs), which is where new features and changes to React are proposed, discussed, and eventually accepted or rejected. You may also be interested in reading the [official React blog](https://react.dev/blog), which will also keep you up-to-date on the latest features.

You're at a point in your React journey where you can begin learning about design patterns and architecture. [patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/) is an exceptional resource that will help you build better React apps by leveraging powerful patterns. They are worth a bookmark!

You have come very far and you should be proud of yourself for getting to this point.
