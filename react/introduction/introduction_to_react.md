### Introduction

This lesson will provide you with information on what React is, its brief history, and why we're choosing to cover it in our curriculum.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Understand what React is

### What is React?

According to the [React](https://react.dev/) website, React is "The library for web and native interfaces." However, let's break this down a bit further.

Generally speaking, a JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written code that's designed to make development easier. This code can be reused/reimplemented in our own codebases to achieve complex tasks.

A library should not be confused with a framework, even though the terms are often used interchangeably. You'll read about differences between libraries and frameworks later on in the lesson.

React provides powerful primitives (built-in functions/modules) that allow us to build user interfaces of varying complexities. Throughout this course, we'll learn all about the functionality React provides and learn to build cool applications.

### Why cover React?

React is one of the most powerful, widely used JavaScript libraries.

The landscape for frontend frameworks has been changing a lot over the last few years, so it's understandable to be worried about choosing the "wrong" one.
[This article on the lifecycle of JavaScript frameworks](https://iamtapan.medium.com/this-is-how-long-the-life-cycle-of-a-javascript-framework-lasts-d21b29320512) shows the recent development of frontend frameworks well.

Once you start diving deeper into a framework, you'll begin to love it. It makes your code easily scalable, more readable, and possibly a thousand times more efficient (in our modest estimation).

To name a few reasons to learn React:

- Components are reusable.
- It's well-supported due to its popularity and large community.
- It's not opinionated, which means it won't force you to follow any specific design patterns, project organizational structure, or logic. It's all up to you.
- There's a smaller learning curve, especially if you already have a good grasp of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from our previous lessons.

If you need more convincing, the recent [2023 StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks-and-technologies) should be reason enough to get excited about learning React.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1.  If you haven't already, browse through the [React Website](https://react.dev/). Don't go too in-depth or dive into documentation, but do read the introduction/homepage to get an idea of how React works.

1.  Glance at [this article which outlines the history of React](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-react-js-on-a-timeline/).

1.  Read this [FreeCodeCamp article discussing the differences between a JavaScript library and a framework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/).

1.  Lastly, skim [this article which explains the main advantages of using React](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-advantages-of-react-js/).
