### Introduction

You're likely somewhat familiar with JSX from previous react lessons, in this lesson we're going to explain _what_ it is, _why_ we use it, and _how_ to use it in your react apps.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- What JSX is.
- Why we use JSX.
- Differences between JSX and html.
- How to write and take advantage of JSX's features.

### What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for Javascript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a Javascript file. It's not required to use JSX when writing react components, but it does make writing them more simple and concise.

Under the hood, JSX elements compile down to react (try logging a JSX component in the console to see for yourself).
