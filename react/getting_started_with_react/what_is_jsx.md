### Introduction

You're likely somewhat familiar with JSX from previous react lessons, in this lesson we're going to explain _what_ it is, _why_ we use it, and _how_ to use it in your react apps.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- What JSX is.
- Why we use JSX.
- Differences between JSX and html.
- How to write and take advantage of JSX's features.

### What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for Javascript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a Javascript file. It's not required to use JSX when writing react components, but it does make writing them more simple and concise.

Under the hood, JSX elements compile down to react (try logging a JSX component in the console to see for yourself).

### Why do we use JSX?

Most of the time in apps, rendering logic and markup are inherently coupled, but we typically separate them by having our logic and markup in separate files. JSX allows React to separate concerns by containing both rendering logic and content in the same place (a component).

On top of this, it's a more intuitive, visual way to work with the UI inside your code, and allows react to show more useful error and warning messages.
