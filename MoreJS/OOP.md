_JS DOES NOT HAVE CLASSES_.  This section is important.. crucial even.
- Prototypal Inheritance:
  - What/How
  - WHY.
  - Prototypes vs. Classes
- Projects may include anything.. will have to brainstorm on that... some sort of game like connect-four or battleship.  Maybe tictactoe if we haven't hit it yet.


Here's a possibility for the oop lessons.  for now i'm linking them, it seems easier for now than flooding this file or creating extras:  
  
* using single objects   
  - https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/02-oop-single-objects.md   
* prototypes  
  - https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/03-prototypes.md
* factories  
  - https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/03-factories.md   
* classical patterns  
  - https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/03-classes.md  
* advanced patterns  
  - this one is in progress  
* fp vs oop  
  - in progress, nearly done.  especially important for people with experience in ruby. To sum this one up - oop and fp refer to the 'basic units' of your program, are they functions or objects?  do you use data bundled with functionality (oop), or functions bundled with data (fp)
