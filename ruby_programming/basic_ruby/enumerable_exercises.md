### Enumerable Exercises
#### 1. Write a program that prints **each** item in a array to the console.

Here are some sample arrays to test your code:

~~~ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#=> 1
#=> 2
#=> 3
#=> 4
#=> 5
~~~

~~~ruby
['oh', 'no', 'pls', 'stahp', 'undo']

#=> 'oh'
#=> 'no'
#=> 'pls'
#=> 'stahp'
#=> 'undo'
~~~

#### 2. Write a program that multiplies each number in a array by 10 and returns a new array with the larger numbers.

Here are some sample arrays to test your code:

`[1, 2, 3, 4]` 
`#=> [10, 20, 30, 40]`

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
`#=> [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]`


#### 3. Write a program that **selects** all the numbers that are less than 10 and returns them in a new array.

Here are some sample arrays to test your code:

`[10, 2, 3, 4, 78, 8, 67, 25]` 
`#=> [2, 3, 4, 8]`

`[1, 22, 3, 7, 50, 89, 9]` 
`#=> [1, 3, 7, 9]`

#### 4. Write a program that returns the sum of all the numbers in an array.

Here are some sample arrays to test your code:

`[10, 20, 30, 40]` 
`#=> 100`

`[1, 2, 3, 7, 10]` 
`#=> 20`

#### 5. Write a program that returns `true` if a array **includes** 15. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

Here are some sample arrays to test your code:

`[10, 15, 30, 40]` 
`#=> true`

`[1, 2, 3, 14, 16]` 
`#=> false`

#### 6. Write a program that returns `true` if **all** the elements in an array are greater than 10. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

Here are some sample arrays to test your code:

`[10,20,30,40]` 
`#=> true`

`[1,2,3,4,5]` 
`#=> false`

`[1,10,2,20,3,30]` 
`#=> false`

#### 7. Write a program that returns `true` if **any** numbers in an array are greater than 10. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

Here are some sample arrays to test your code:

`[10,20,30,40]` 
`#=> true`

`[2,8,17,89,50,3]` 
`#=> true`

`[1,2,3,4,5]` 
`#=> false`
