### What We're Doing in This Tutorial

Imagine that a friend of yours runs a non-profit organization around political activism.
A number of people have registered for an upcoming event. She has asked for your help in
engaging these future attendees. For the first task, she wants you to find the government 
representatives for each attendee based on their zip code.

### Initial Setup

Create a project directory folder named `event_manager` wherever you want to store 
your project. In the project directory, create another folder named `lib` and inside 
that folder create a plain text file named `event_manager.rb`. Using your command-line 
interface (CLI), you can enter the following commands:

~~~bash
$ mkdir event_manager
$ cd event_manager
$ mkdir lib
$ touch lib/event_manager.rb
~~~

Creating and placing your `event_manager.rb` file in `lib` directory is entirely
optional; however, it adheres to a common convention within most ruby applications.
The filepaths we use in this tutorial will assume that we have put our `event_manager.rb`
file within the `lib` directory.

Ruby source file names should be written all in lower-case characters and
instead of camel-casing multiple words together, they are instead separated by an
underscore (often called *snake_case*).

Open `lib/event_manager.rb` in your text editor and add the line:

~~~ruby
puts 'Event Manager Initialized!'
~~~

Validate that ruby is installed correctly and you have created the file correctly by running it from the root of your `event_manager` directory:


~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
Event Manager Initialized!
~~~

If ruby is not installed and available on your environment path then you will be presented with the following message:


~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
-bash: ruby: command not found
~~~

If this happens, see [the instructions for installing Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/installing-ruby-ruby-programming).

If the file was not created then you will be presented with the following error
message:


~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
ruby: No such file or directory -- lib/event_manager.rb (LoadError)
~~~

If this happens, make sure the correct directory exists and try creating the file again.

For this project we are going to use the following sample data:

* [Small Sample](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/tree/main/ruby_programming/files_and_serialization/event_attendees.csv)
* [Large Sample](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/tree/main/ruby_programming/files_and_serialization/event_attendees_full.csv)

Download the *[small sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/ruby_programming/files_and_serialization/event_attendees.csv)* csv file and save it in the root of the project directory, `event_manager`. Using your CLI, confirm that you are in the right directory and enter the following command:

~~~bash
$ curl -o event_attendees.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/ruby_programming/files_and_serialization/event_attendees.csv
~~~

After the file is downloaded, you should see something like:

~~~bash
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  2125  100  2125    0     0   3269      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 12073
~~~


## Iteration 0: Loading a File

A comma-separated values
[(CSV)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file stores
tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. The CSV format is readable
by a large number of applications (e.g. Excel, Numbers, Calc). Its portability
makes it a popular option when sharing large sets of tabular data from a
database or spreadsheet applications.

The first few rows of the CSV file you downloaded look like this:

~~~bash
,RegDate,first_Name,last_Name,Email_Address,HomePhone,Street,City,State,Zipcode
1,11/12/08 10:47,Allison,Nguyen,arannon@jumpstartlab.com,6154385000,3155 19th St NW,Washington,DC,20010
2,11/12/08 13:23,SArah,Hankins,pinalevitsky@jumpstartlab.com,414-520-5000,2022 15th Street NW,Washington,DC,20009
3,11/12/08 13:30,Sarah,Xx,lqrm4462@jumpstartlab.com,(941)979-2000,4175 3rd Street North,Saint Petersburg,FL,33703
4,11/25/08 19:21,David,Thomas,gdlia.lepping@jumpstartlab.com,650-799-0000,9 garrison ave,Jersey City,NJ,7306
~~~

### Read the File Contents

[File](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/File) is a core ruby class that allows
you to perform a large number of operations on files on your filesystem. The
most straightforward is `File.read`.

~~~ruby
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = File.read('event_attendees.csv')
puts contents
~~~

In this example, it does not matter whether you use single quotes or double quotes. 
There are differences, but they are essentially the same when representing a string 
of characters, such as this initial greeting or the name of the file.

We are assuming the file is present here. However, it is a good practice to confirm 
that a file exists. File has the ability to check if a file exists at the specified 
filepath on the filesystem through `File.exist? "event_attendees.csv"`.


### Read the File Line By Line

Reading and displaying the entire contents of the file showed us how to quickly
access the data. Our goal is to display the first names of all the attendees.
There are numerous [String](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String) methods
that would allow us to manipulate this large string. Using `File.readlines` will 
save each line as a separate item in an array.

~~~ruby
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

lines = File.readlines('event_attendees.csv')
lines.each do |line|
  puts line
end
~~~

First, we read the entire contents of the file as an array of lines. Second, we 
iterate over the array of lines and output the contents of each line.

### Display the First Names of All Attendees

Instead of outputting the entire contents of each line we want to show only the
first name. That requires us to look at the current contents of our Event
Attendees file.

~~~ruby
 ,RegDate,first_Name,last_Name,Email_Address,HomePhone,Street,City,State,Zipcode
1,11/12/08 10:47,Allison,Nguyen,arannon@jumpstartlab.com,6154385000,3155 19th St NW,Washington,DC,20010
~~~

The first row contains header information. This row provides descriptional text
for each column of data. It tells us the data columns are laid out as follows
from left-to-right:

* `ID` - the empty column represents a unique identifier or row number of all
  the subsequent rows
* `RegDate` - the date the user registered for the event
* `first_Name` - their first name
* `last_Name` - their last name
* `Email_Address` - their email address
* `HomePhone` - their home phone number
* `Street` - their street address
* `City` - their city
* `State` - their state
* `Zipcode` - their zipcode

The lack of consistent formatting of these headers is not ideal when
choosing to model your own data. These column names are our extreme
example of a poorly formed external service. Great applications are often built
on the backs of such services.

We are interested in the `first_Name` column. At the moment, we have a string of
text that represents the entire row. We need to convert the string into an
array of columns. The separation of the columns can be identified by the comma
`","` separator. We want to split the string into pieces wherever we see a comma.

Ruby's
[String#split](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#split-instance_method) 
allows you to convert a string of text into an array along a particular character. 
By default when you send the split message to the String without a parameter it
will break the string apart along each space `" "` character. Therefore, we need to 
specify the comma `","` character to separate the columns.

~~~ruby
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

lines = File.readlines('event_attendees.csv')
lines.each do |line|
  columns = line.split(",")
  p columns
end
~~~

Within our array of columns we want to access our 'first_Name'. This would be
the third column or third element at the array's second index `columns[2]`. 
Remember, arrays start counting at 0 instead of 1, so `columns[0]` is how we 
would access the array's first element, and `columns[2]` will give us the third.

~~~ruby
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

lines = File.readlines('event_attendees.csv')
lines.each do |line|
  columns = line.split(",")
  name = columns[2]
  puts name
end
~~~

### Skipping the Header Row

The header row was a great help to us in understanding the contents of the CSV
file. However, the row itself does not represent an actual attendee. To ensure
that we only output attendees, we could remove the header row from the file, but
that would make it difficult if we later returned to the file and tried to
understand the columns of data.

Another option is to ignore the first row when we display the names. Currently
we handle all the rows exactly the same, which makes it difficult to understand
which one is the header row.

One way to solve this problem would be to skip the line when it exactly matches
our current header row.

~~~ruby
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

lines = File.readlines('event_attendees.csv')
lines.each do |line|
  next if line == " ,RegDate,first_Name,last_Name,Email_Address,HomePhone,Street,City,State,Zipcode\n"
  columns = line.split(",")
  name = columns[2]
  puts name
end
~~~

When this program is run, the `next if` line checks every line to see if it matches the provided string. If so, it skips that line from the rest of the loop.

A problem with this solution is that the content of our header row could change
in the future. Additional columns could be added or the existing columns
updated.

A second way to solve this problem is for us to track the index of the current
line.

~~~ruby
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

lines = File.readlines('event_attendees.csv')
row_index = 0
lines.each do |line|
  row_index = row_index + 1
  next if row_index == 1
  columns = line.split(",")
  name = columns[2]
  puts name
end
~~~

This is a such a common operation that Array defines
[Array#each_with_index](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Enumerable#each_with_index-instance_method).

~~~ruby
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

lines = File.readlines('event_attendees.csv')
lines.each_with_index do |line,index|
  next if index == 0
  columns = line.split(",")
  name = columns[2]
  puts name
end
~~~

This solves the problem if the header row were to change in the future. It
assumes that the header row is the first row in the file.


### Look for a Solution before Building a Solution

Either of these solutions would be *OK* given our current attendees file.
Problems may arise if we are given a new CSV file that is generated or
manipulated by another source. This is because the CSV parser that we have
started to create does not take into account a number of other features
supported by the CSV file format.

Two important ones:

* CSV files often contain comments which are lines that start with a pound (#) character
* A column is unable to support a value which contains a comma (,) character

Our goal is to get in contact with our event attendees. It is not to define a
CSV parser. This is often a hard concept to let go of when initially solving a
problem with programming. An important rule to abide by while building software
is:

> Look for a Solution before Building a Solution

Ruby actually provides a CSV parser that we will use instead throughout the
remainder of this exercise.

## Iteration 1: Parsing with CSV

It is likely the case that if you want to solve a problem, someone has already
done it in some capacity. They may have even been kind enough to share their
solution or the tools that they created. This is the kind of goodwill that
pervades the Open Source community and Ruby ecosystem.

In this iteration we are going to convert our current CSV parser to use Ruby's [CSV](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/csv).
We will then use this new parser to access our attendees' zip codes.

### Switching over to use the CSV Library

Ruby's core language comes with a wealth of great classes. Not all of them are
loaded every single time ruby code is executed. This ensures unneeded
functionality is not loaded unless required, preventing ruby from having
slower start up times.

You can browse the many libraries available through the [documentation](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib).

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open('event_attendees.csv', headers: true)
contents.each do |row|
  name = row[2]
  puts name
end
~~~

First we need to tell Ruby that we want it to load the CSV library. This is done
through the `require` method which accepts a parameter of the functionality to
load.

The way [CSV](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/csv) loads and parses data is very
similar to what we previously defined.

Instead of `read` or `readlines` we use CSV's `open` method to load our file.
The library also supports the concept of headers and so we provide some
additional parameters which state this file has headers.

There are pros and cons to using an external library. One of the pros is that 
this library makes it easy for us to express that our file has headers. One of 
the cons is that we have to learn how the library is implemented.

### Accessing Columns by their Names

CSV files with headers have an additional option which allows you to access
the column values by their headers. Our CSV file defines several different
formats for the column names. The CSV library provides an additional option
which allows us to convert the header names to symbols.

Converting the headers to symbols will make our column names more uniform and
easier to remember. The header "first_Name" will be converted to `:first_name` 
and "HomePhone" will be converted to `:homephone`.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true, 
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]
  puts name
end
~~~

### Displaying the Zip Codes of All Attendees

Accessing the zipcode is very easy using the new header name, `:zipcode`.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]
  zipcode = row[:zipcode]
  puts "#{name} #{zipcode}"
end
~~~

We now are able to output the name of the individual and their zipcode.

Now that we are able to visualize both pieces of data we realize that we
have a problem....

## Iteration 2: Cleaning up our Zip Codes

The zip codes in our small sample show us:

* Most zip codes are correctly expressed as a five-digit number
* Some zip codes are represented with fewer than five digits
* Some zip codes are missing

Before we are able to figure out our attendees' representatives, we need to
solve the second issue and the third issue.

* Some zip codes are represented with fewer than five digits

If we looked at the [larger sample of data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/ruby_programming/files_and_serialization/event_attendees_full.csv), we would
see that the majority of the shorter zip codes are from states in the 
north-eastern part of the United States. Many zip codes there start with 0. This
data was likely stored in the database as an integer, and not as text, which 
caused the leading zeros to be removed.

So in the case of zip codes of fewer than five digits, we will assume that we can
pad missing zeros to the front.

* Some zip codes are missing

Some of our attendees are missing a zip code. It is likely that they forgot to
enter the data when they filled out the form. The zip code data was not likely
marked as mandatory and so our future attendees were not presented with an
error message.

We could try to figure out the zip code based on the rest of the address
provided. But we could be wrong with our guess, so instead we will use a default,
bad zip code of "00000".

### Pseudocode for Cleaning Zip Codes

Before we start to explore a solution with Ruby code it is often helpful to
express what we are hoping to accomplish in English words.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv', 
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]
  zipcode = row[:zipcode]

  # if the zip code is exactly five digits, assume that it is ok
  # if the zip code is more than five digits, truncate it to the first five digits
  # if the zip code is less than five digits, add zeros to the front until it becomes five digits

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode}"
 end
~~~

* if the zip code is exactly five digits, assume that it is ok

In the case when the zip code is five digits in length we have it easy. We
simply want to do nothing.

* if the zip code is more than five digits, truncate it to the first five digits

While zip codes can be expressed with additional resolution (more digits after
a dash), we are only interested in the first five digits.

* if the zip code is less than five digits, add zeros to the front until it
  becomes five digits

There are many possible ways that we can solve this issue. These are a few
paths:

  * Use a `while` or `until` loop to prepend zeros until the length is five
  * Calculate the length of the current zip code and add missing zeros to the front
  * Add five zeros to the front of the current zip code and then trim the last five digits
  * Use [String#rjust](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#rjust-instance_method) to append zeros to the front of the string.

### Handling Bad and Good Zip Codes

The following solution employs:

* [String#length](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#length-instance_method) - returns the length of the string.
* [String#rjust](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#rjust-instance_method) - to pad the string with zeros.
* [String#slice](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#slice-instance_method) - to create sub-strings either through the `slice` method or the array-like notation `[]`

~~~ruby
require 'csv'

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv', 
  headers: true, 
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]
  zipcode = row[:zipcode]

  if zipcode.length < 5
    zipcode = zipcode.rjust(5, '0')
  elsif zipcode.length > 5
    zipcode = zipcode[0..4]
  end

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode}"
end
~~~

When we run our application, we see the first few lines output correctly and then the
application terminates.


~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
EventManager initialized.
Allison 20010
SArah 20009
Sarah 33703
David 07306
lib/event_manager.rb:11:in `block in <main>': undefined method `length' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
	from /Users/burtlo/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p374/lib/ruby/1.9.1/csv.rb:1792:in `each'
	from lib/event_manager.rb:7:in `<main>'
~~~

* What is the error message "undefined method 'length' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)" saying?

Reviewing our CSV data, we notice that the next row specifies no value. An empty
field translates into a nil instead of an empty string. This is a choice made by
the CSV library maintainers. So we now need to handle this situation.

### Handling Missing Zip Codes

Our solution above does not handle the case when the zip code has not been
specified. CSV returns a `nil` value when no value has been specified in the
column. All objects in Ruby respond to `#nil?`. All objects will return false
except for a `nil`.

We can update our implementation to handle this new case by simply adding a
check for `nil?`.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]
  zipcode = row[:zipcode]

  if zipcode.nil?
    zipcode = '00000'
  elsif zipcode.length < 5
    zipcode = zipcode.rjust(5, '0')
  elsif zipcode.length > 5
    zipcode = zipcode[0..4]
  end

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode}"
end
~~~


~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
EventManager initialized.

### Moving Clean Zip Codes to a Method

It is important for us to take a look at our implementation. During this
examination we should ask ourselves:

* Does the code clearly express what it is trying to accomplish?

The implementation does a decent job at expressing what it accomplishes. The
biggest problem is that it is expressing this near so many other concepts. To
make this implementation clearer we should move this logic into its own method
named `clean_zipcode`.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'

def clean_zipcode(zipcode)
  if zipcode.nil?
    '00000'
  elsif zipcode.length < 5
    zipcode.rjust(5, '0')
  elsif zipcode.length > 5
    zipcode[0..4]
  else
    zipcode
  end
end

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode}"
end
~~~

This may feel like a very small, inconsequential change, but small changes
like these help make your code cleaner and your intent clearer.

### Refactoring Clean Zip Codes

With our clean zip code logic tucked away in our `clean_zipcode` method, we can
examine it further to see if we can make it even more succinct.

* Coercion over Questions

A good rule when developing in Ruby is to favor coercing values into similar
values so that they will behave the same. We have a special case to deal
specifically with a `nil` value. It would be much easier if instead of checking
for a nil value, we convert the `nil` into a string with
[NilClass#to_s](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/NilClass#to_s-instance_method).

~~~ruby
$ nil.to_s
=> ""
~~~

Examining
[String#rjust](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#rjust-instance_method) in 
irb, we can see that when we provide a string with a length greater than five, 
it performs no work. This means we can apply it in both cases, as it will have the 
same intended effect.

~~~ruby
$ "123456".rjust(5, '0')
=> "123456"
~~~

Lastly, examining
[String#slice](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#slice-instance_method) in
irb, we can see that for a number that is exactly five digits in length, it has no
effect. This also means we can apply it in cases when the zip code is five or more
digits, and it will have the same effect.

~~~ruby
$ "12345"[0..4]
=> "12345"
~~~

Combining all of these steps together, we can write a more succinct
`clean_zipcode` method:

~~~ruby
def clean_zipcode(zipcode)
  zipcode.to_s.rjust(5, '0')[0..4]
end
~~~

## Iteration 3: Using Google's Civic Information

We now have our list of attendees with their valid zip codes (at least for most
of them). Using their zip code and the
[Google Civic Information](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/)
webservice, we are able to query for the representatives of a given area.

The Civic Information API allows registered individuals (registration is free) to obtain some information about the representatives for each level of government for an address.

> For any U.S. residential address, you can look up who represents that address at each elected level of
> government. During supported elections, you can also look up polling places, early vote location, candidate data,
> and other election official information.

### Accessing the API

Take a close look at this sample URL for accessing the Civic Information API:

[https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/representatives?address=80203&levels=country&roles=legislatorUpperBody&roles=legislatorLowerBody&key=AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw](https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/representatives?address=80203&levels=country&roles=legislatorUpperBody&roles=legislatorLowerBody&key=AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw)

Here's how it breaks down:

* `https://` : Use the Secure HTTP protocol
* `www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/` : The API server address on the internet
* `representatives` : The method called on that server
* `?` : Parameters to the method
  * `&` : The parameter separator
  * `address=80203` : The zipcode we want to lookup
  * `levels=country` : The level of government we want to select
  * `roles=legislatorUpperBody` : Return the representatives from the Senate
  * `roles=legislatorLowerBody` : Returns the representatives from the House
  * `key=AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw` : A registered API Key to authenticate our requests

When we're accessing the `representatives` method of their API, we're sending in a `key` which is the string that identifies JumpstartLab as the accessor of
the API, then we're selecting the data we want returned to us using the `address`, `levels`, and `roles` criteria. Try modifying the address with your own zipcode and load the page.

This document is [JSON](http://json.org/) formatted. If you copy and paste the data into a [pretty printer](https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print), you can see there is an `officials` key that has many legislator `names`. The response also includes a lot of other information. Cool!

Let's look for a solution before we attempt to build a solution.

### Installing the Google API Client

Ruby comes packaged with the `gem` command. This tool allows you to download
libraries by simply knowing the name of the library you want to install.


~~~bash
$ gem install google-api-client
Successfully installed google-api-client-0.15.0
1 gem installed
~~~

If you receive a signet error when installing the Google API gem, it is due to modern Ruby updates requiring an updated version of signet that is not compatible with the API. To fix, please [downgrade your version of signet](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client/issues/833) before installing the gem. 

### Showing All Legislators in a Zip Code

The gem comes equipped with some vague example documentation. The documentation is also
available online with their [source code](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client).

Reading through the documentation on how to set up and use the
google-api-client gem, we find that we need to perform the following steps:

* Set the API Key
* Send the query with the given criteria
* Parse the response for the names of your legislators.

Exploration of data is easy using irb:

~~~ruby
$ require 'google/apis/civicinfo_v2'
=> true

$ civic_info = Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService.new
=> #<Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService:0x007faf2dd47108 ... >

$ civic_info.key = 'AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw'
=> "AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw"

$ response = civic_info.representative_info_by_address(address: 80202, levels: 'country', roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody'])
=> #<Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::RepresentativeInfoResponse:0x007faf2d9088d0 @divisions={"ocd-division/country:us/state:co"=>#<Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::GeographicDivision:0x007faf2e55ea80 @name="Colorado", @office_indices=[0]> } > ...continues...
~~~

Whoa. That's a lot of information.  Buried in there are the names of our legislators.  We can access them by calling the `.officials` method on the `response`.  Now that we know how to access the information we want, we can focus our attention back on our program.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
require 'google/apis/civicinfo_v2'

civic_info = Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService.new
civic_info.key = 'AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw'

def clean_zipcode(zipcode)
  zipcode.to_s.rjust(5, '0')[0..4]
end

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  legislators = civic_info.representative_info_by_address(
    address: zipcode,
    levels: 'country',
    roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody']
  )
  legislators = legislators.officials

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode} #{legislators}"
end
~~~

Running our application, we find an error.


~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
/ruby-2.4.0/gems/google-api-client-0.15.0/lib/google/apis/core/http_command.rb:218:in 'check_status': parseError: Failed to parse address (Google::Apis::ClientError)
~~~

What does this mean?  It means that the Google API was unable to use an address we gave it.  When we dig further, we see that right before this error the information from David with a zip code of 07306 is printed. Looking at the data we can now see that the attendee after David did not enter a zip code.  Data missing like this is common, so we have to have a way of dealing with it. Luckily, Ruby makes that easy with its [Exception Class](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Exception.html).  We can add a `begin` and `rescue` clause to the API search to handle any errors.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
require 'google/apis/civicinfo_v2'

civic_info = Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService.new
civic_info.key = 'AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw'

def clean_zipcode(zipcode)
  zipcode.to_s.rjust(5, '0')[0..4]
end

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  begin
    legislators = civic_info.representative_info_by_address(
      address: zipcode,
      levels: 'country',
      roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody']
    )
    legislators = legislators.officials
  rescue
    'You can find your representatives by visiting www.commoncause.org/take-action/find-elected-officials'
  end

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode} #{legislators}"
end
~~~

The **legislators** that we are displaying is an array. In turn, the array is
sending the `to_s` message to each of the objects within the array, each
legislator. The output that we are seeing is the *raw* legislator object.

We really want to capture the first name and last name of each legislator.

### Collecting the Names of the Legislators

Instead of outputting each raw legislator we want to print only their first
name and last name. We will need to complete the following steps:

* For each zip code, iterate over the array of legislators.
* For each legislator, we want to find the representative's name.
* Add the name to a new collection of names.

To do this, we can use the [map](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-map) function built into ruby.  It works just like `.each` but returns a new array of the data we want to include.

~~~ruby
legislator_names = legislators.map do |legislator|
    legislator.name
  end
~~~

We can further simplify this into its final form:

~~~ruby
legislator_names = legislators.map(&:name)
~~~

### Cleanly Displaying Legislators

If we were to replace `legislators` with `legislator_names` in our output, we would be presented with a *slightly* better output.

~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
EventManager initialized.
Allison 20010 ["Eleanor Norton"]
SArah 20009 ["Eleanor Norton"]
Sarah 33703 ["Marco Rubio", "Bill Nelson", "C. Young"]
...
~~~

The problem now is that when using string interpolation, Ruby is converting our new array of legislator names into a string, but Ruby does not know exactly how _you_ want to display the contents.

We need to explicitly convert our array of legislator names to a string. This way we are sure it will output correctly. This could be tedious work except Array again comes to the rescue with the [Array#join](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Array#join-instance_method) method.

[Array#join](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Array#join-instance_method) allows the specification of a separator string. We want to create a comma-separated list of legislator names with `legislator_names.join(", ")`

~~~ruby
contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  begin
    legislators = civic_info.representative_info_by_address(
      address: zipcode,
      levels: 'country',
      roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody']
    )
    legislators = legislators.officials

    legislator_names = legislators.map(&:name)

    legislators_string = legislator_names.join(", ")
  rescue
    'You can find your representatives by visiting www.commoncause.org/take-action/find-elected-officials'
  end

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode} #{legislators_string}"
end
~~~

Running our application this time should give us a much more pleasant looking
output:


~~~bash
$ ruby lib/event_manager.rb
EventManager initialized.
Allison 20010 Eleanor Norton
SArah 20009 Eleanor Norton
Sarah 33703 Marco Rubio, Bill Nelson, C. Young
...
~~~

### Moving Displaying Legislators to a Method

Similar to before, with this step complete, we want to look at our
implementation and ask ourselves:

* Does the code clearly express what it is trying to accomplish?

This code is fairly clear in its understanding. It is simply expressing its
intent near so many other things. It is also expressing itself differently from
how zip codes are handled. This dissimilarity breeds confusion when returning to
the code.

We want to extract our legislator names into a new method named
`legislators_by_zipcode`, which accepts a single zip code as a parameter
and returns a comma-separated string of legislator names.

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
require 'google/apis/civicinfo_v2'


def clean_zipcode(zipcode)
  zipcode.to_s.rjust(5, '0')[0..4]
end

def legislators_by_zipcode(zip)
  civic_info = Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService.new
  civic_info.key = 'AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw'

  begin
    legislators = civic_info.representative_info_by_address(
      address: zip,
      levels: 'country',
      roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody']
    )
    legislators = legislators.officials
    legislator_names = legislators.map(&:name)
    legislator_names.join(", ")
  rescue
    'You can find your representatives by visiting www.commoncause.org/take-action/find-elected-officials'
  end
end

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  legislators = legislators_by_zipcode(zipcode)

  puts "#{name} #{zipcode} #{legislators}"
end
~~~

An additional benefit of this implementation is that it encapsulates how we
actually retrieve the names of the legislators. This will be of benefit later if we
decide on an alternative to the google-api gem or want to introduce a level of
caching to prevent look ups for similar zip codes.

## Iteration 4: Form Letters

We have our attendees and their respective representatives. We can now generate
a personalized call to action.

For each attendee we want to include a customized letter that thanks them for
attending the conference and provides a list of their representatives.
Something that looks like:

~~~html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset='utf-8'>
  <title>Thank You!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Thanks FIRST_NAME!</h1>
  <p>Thanks for coming to our conference.  We couldn't have done it without you!</p>

  <p>
    Political activism is at the heart of any democracy and your voice needs to be heard.
    Please consider reaching out to your following representatives:
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Legislators</th></tr>
    <tr><td>LEGISLATORS</td></tr>
  </table>
</body>
</html>
~~~

### Storing our template to a file

We could define this template as a large string within our current application.

~~~ruby
form_letter = %{
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>Thank You!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Thanks FIRST_NAME!</h1>
    <p>Thanks for coming to our conference.  We couldn't have done it without you!</p>

    <p>
      Political activism is at the heart of any democracy and your voice needs to be heard.
      Please consider reaching out to your following representatives:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Legislators</th></tr>
      <tr><td>LEGISLATORS</td></tr>
    </table>
  </body>
  </html>
}
~~~

Ruby has quite a few ways that we can define strings. This format `%{ String
Contents }` is one choice when defining a string that spans multiple lines.

However, placing this large blob of text, this template, within our application
will make it much more difficult to understand the template and the application
code and thus make it more difficult to change the template and the application
code.

Instead of including the template within our application, we will instead load
the template using the same File tools we used at the beginning of the exercise.

* Create a file named 'form_letter.html' in the root of your project directory.
* Copy the html template defined above into that file and save it.

Within our application we will load our template:

~~~ruby
template_letter = File.read('form_letter.html')
~~~

It is important to define the `form_letter.html` file in the root of project
directory and not in the lib directory. This is because when the application
runs it assumes the place that you started the application is where all file
references will be located. Later, we move the file to a new location and are
more explicit on defining the location of the template.


### Replacing with `gsub` and `gsub!`

For each of our attendees we want to replace the `FIRST_NAME` and `LEGISLATORS` with their respective values.

* We need to find all instances of `FIRST_NAME` and replace them with the individual's first name.
* We need to find all instances of `LEGISLATORS` and replace them with the individual's representatives.

Our template is a String of text which has two methods for replacing text:
[String#gsub](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#gsub-instance_method) and
[String#gsub!](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#gsub%21-instance_method).

These two methods are almost identical save for one important difference. The
method `gsub` returns a **new copy** of the original string with the values
replaced. Whereas `gsub!` will replace the values in the original string.

We have our template letter which we want to use for every attendee. It is
important that we create a new copy of this letter for each attendee. If we
change the original template, they'd all have the same name! By making a copy
and then changing the copy, we're sure everyone's name is unique.

~~~ruby
template_letter = File.read('form_letter.html')

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  legislators = legislators_by_zipcode(zipcode)

  personal_letter = template_letter.gsub('FIRST_NAME', name)
  personal_letter.gsub!('LEGISLATORS', legislators)

  puts personal_letter
end
~~~

We replace the first name in the template letter and return a new copy (Thanks
[String#gsub](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#gsub-instance_method)). We
save the new letter to a personal version of the letter `personal_letter`. We
then replace all the legislators with our legislators information in
`personal_letter` (Thanks
[String#gsub!](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String#gsub%21-instance_method)).

Methods like `gsub` and `gsub!` can often be confusing and when to use one over
the other may not be immediately clear. The above template manipulation could
have been written with just `gsub`:

~~~ruby
personal_letter = template_letter.gsub('FIRST_NAME', name)
personal_letter = personal_letter.gsub('LEGISLATORS', legislators)
~~~

### Our Template System has Problems

It is a treacherous road we start to walk, defining our own templating language.
Our current system has some flaws:

* Using FIRST_NAME and LEGISLATORS to find and replace might cause us problems if later somehow this text appears in any of our templates.

Though not likely, imagine if a person's name contained the word 'LEGISLATORS'.
When we perform the second replacement operation, that part of the person's name
would also be replaced. This is unlikely in our simple template, but as our
template grows, we may invite such disasters.

* We cannot represent multiple items very easily if they are surrounded by HTML.

Currently we copied our legislators string into a single table column. We would
have a hard time inserting our legislators as individual rows in the table
without having to build parts of the HTML table ourself. This could spell
disaster later if we decide to change the template to no longer use a table.

So again, instead of building our own custom solution any further, we are going to
seek a solution.

### Ruby's ERB

Ruby defines a template language named [ERB](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/erb/frames).

> ERB provides an easy to use but powerful templating system for Ruby. Using ERB, actual Ruby code can be added to
> any plain text document for the purposes of generating document information details and/or flow control.

Defining an ERB template is extremely similar to our existing template. The
difference is that we use escape sequence tags which allow us to insert any
variables, methods or ruby code we want to execute.

ERB defines several different escape sequence tags that we can use. The most
common are:

~~~ruby
<%= ruby code will execute and show output %>
<% ruby code will execute but not show output %>
~~~

We can define our ERB escape tags within any string. The ruby defined within
the contents of the ERB tags will not be evaluated until we ask the template to
give us the results.

~~~ruby
require 'erb'

meaning_of_life = 42

question = "The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is <%= meaning_of_life %>"
template = ERB.new question

results = template.result(binding)
puts results
~~~

The code above loads the ERB library, then creates a new ERB template with the
`question` string. The question string contains ERB tags that will show the
results of the variable `meaning_of_life`. We send the `result` message to the
template with `binding`.

* What is `binding`?

The method
[binding](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Kernel#binding-instance_method)
returns a special object. This object is an instance of
[Binding](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Binding). An instance of binding knows
all about the current state of variables and methods within the given scope. In
this case, `binding` knows about the variable `meaning_of_life`.

Having to explicitly specify a binding when we ask for the results of the
template gives us the flexibility to ask for the results of a template given a
different binding.

### Defining an ERB Template

To use ERB we need to update our current template **form_letter.html**.

* Save a new template as **form_letter.erb**

The convention is to save ERB template files with the extension **erb**. This
is not a requirement. It is a benefit to yourself and other users when they
return to the application.

* Update our existing keywords with the ERB escape sequences

~~~erb
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset='utf-8'>
  <title>Thank You!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Thanks <%= name %></h1>
  <p>Thanks for coming to our conference.  We couldn't have done it without you!</p>

  <p>
    Political activism is at the heart of any democracy and your voice needs to be heard.
    Please consider reaching out to your following representatives:
  </p>

  <table>
    <% if legislators.kind_of?(Array) %>
      <th>Name</th><th>Website</th>
        <% legislators.each do |legislator| %>
        <tr>
          <td><%= "#{legislator.name}" %></td>
          <td><%= "#{legislator.urls.join}" unless legislator.urls.nil? %></td>
        </tr>
        <% end %>
    <% else %>
      <th></th>
      <td><%= "#{legislators}" %></td>
    <% end %>
  </table>
</body>
</html>
~~~

The use of the ERB tags to display the attendee's name is familiar from our previous example. The second use, when we display the legislators, is different. We are using the ERB tag that does not output the results `<% %>` to check if the legislators variable is an Array.

If it is an array, we output the name and website url of each legislator. This is a departure from what we originally implemented. Before we had to build the names of all the representatives. We intend now to give the template direct access to the array of legislators. We will let the template ask and display what it wants from each legislator.

If `legislators` is not an array, it means that the `legislators_by_zipcode` method entered the rescue clause, which outputs a string. We simply want to display that string.


### Using ERB

We now need to update our application to:

* Require the ERB library
* Create the ERB template from the contents of the template file
* Simplify our `legislators_by_zipcode` to return the original array of legislators

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
require 'google/apis/civicinfo_v2'
require 'erb'

def clean_zipcode(zipcode)
  zipcode.to_s.rjust(5,"0")[0..4]
end

def legislators_by_zipcode(zip)
  civic_info = Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService.new
  civic_info.key = 'AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw'

  begin
    civic_info.representative_info_by_address(
      address: zip,
      levels: 'country',
      roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody']
    ).officials
  rescue
    'You can find your representatives by visiting www.commoncause.org/take-action/find-elected-officials'
  end
end

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

template_letter = File.read('form_letter.erb')
erb_template = ERB.new template_letter

contents.each do |row|
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  legislators = legislators_by_zipcode(zipcode)

  form_letter = erb_template.result(binding)
  puts form_letter
end
~~~

* Require the ERB library

First we need to tell Ruby that we want it to load the ERB library. This is done
through the `require` method which accepts a parameter of the functionality to
load.

* Create the ERB template from the contents of the template file

Creating our template from our new template file requires us to load the file
contents as a string and provide them as a parameter when creating the new ERB
template.

~~~ruby
template_letter = File.read('form_letter.erb')
erb_template = ERB.new template_letter
~~~

* Simplify our `legislators_by_zipcode` to return the original array of legislators

~~~ruby
def legislators_by_zipcode(zip)
  civic_info = Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService.new
  civic_info.key = 'AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw'

  begin
    civic_info.representative_info_by_address(
      address: zip,
      levels: 'country',
      roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody']
    ).officials
  rescue
    'You can find your representatives by visiting www.commoncause.org/take-action/find-elected-officials'
  end
end
~~~

### Outputting form letters to a file

Outputting each form letter to the screen was useful for ensuring our output
looked correct. It is time to save each form letter to a file.

Each file should be uniquely named. Fortunately, each of our attendees has a
unique id—the first column, or row number.

* Assign an ID for the attendee
* Create an output folder
* Save each form letter to a file based on the id of the attendee


~~~ruby
contents.each do |row|
  id = row[0]
  name = row[:first_name]

  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])

  legislators = legislators_by_zipcode(zipcode)

  form_letter = erb_template.result(binding)

  Dir.mkdir('output') unless Dir.exist?('output')

  filename = "output/thanks_#{id}.html"

  File.open(filename, 'w') do |file|
    file.puts form_letter
  end

end
~~~

* Assign an ID for the attendee

The first column does not have a name like the other columns, so we fall back
to using the index value.

* Create an output folder

We make a directory named "output" if a directory named "output" does not
already exist.

~~~ruby
Dir.mkdir('output') unless Dir.exist?('output')
~~~

* Save each form letter to a file based on the id of the attendee

[File#open](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/File#open-class_method) allows us
to open a file for reading and writing. The first parameter is the name of the
file. The second parameter is a flag that states how we want to open the file.
The `w` states we want to open the file for writing. If the file already exists
it will be destroyed.

Afterwards we actually send the entire form letter content to the file
object. The `file` object responds to the message `puts`. The method
[IO#puts](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/IO#puts-instance_method), from which the `file` object inherits, is similar to
 [Kernel#puts](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Kernel#puts-instance_method)
which we have been using up to this point.

### Moving Form Letter Generation to a Method

Again, for the sake of writing clean and clear code, we want to move the
operation of saving the form letter to its own method:

~~~ruby
require 'csv'
require 'google/apis/civicinfo_v2'
require 'erb'

def clean_zipcode(zipcode)
  zipcode.to_s.rjust(5,"0")[0..4]
end

def legislators_by_zipcode(zip)
  civic_info = Google::Apis::CivicinfoV2::CivicInfoService.new
  civic_info.key = 'AIzaSyClRzDqDh5MsXwnCWi0kOiiBivP6JsSyBw'

  begin
    civic_info.representative_info_by_address(
      address: zip,
      levels: 'country',
      roles: ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody']
    ).officials
  rescue
    'You can find your representatives by visiting www.commoncause.org/take-action/find-elected-officials'
  end
end

def save_thank_you_letter(id,form_letter)
  Dir.mkdir('output') unless Dir.exist?('output')

  filename = "output/thanks_#{id}.html"

  File.open(filename, 'w') do |file|
    file.puts form_letter
  end
end

puts 'EventManager initialized.'

contents = CSV.open(
  'event_attendees.csv',
  headers: true,
  header_converters: :symbol
)

template_letter = File.read('form_letter.erb')
erb_template = ERB.new template_letter

contents.each do |row|
  id = row[0]
  name = row[:first_name]
  zipcode = clean_zipcode(row[:zipcode])
  legislators = legislators_by_zipcode(zipcode)

  form_letter = erb_template.result(binding)

  save_thank_you_letter(id,form_letter)
end
~~~

The method `save_thank_you_letter` requires the id of the attendee and the form letter
output.

## Assignment: Clean Phone Numbers

Similar to the zip codes, the phone numbers suffer from multiple formats and
inconsistencies. If we wanted to allow individuals to sign up for mobile alerts
with the phone numbers, we would need to make sure all of the numbers are valid
and well-formed.

* If the phone number is less than 10 digits, assume that it is a bad number
* If the phone number is 10 digits, assume that it is good
* If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1 and use the remaining 10 digits
* If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then it is a bad number
* If the phone number is more than 11 digits, assume that it is a bad number

## Assignment: Time Targeting

The boss is already thinking about the next conference: "Next year I want to
make better use of our Google and Facebook advertising. Find out which hours of
the day the most people registered, so we can run more ads during those hours."
Interesting!

Using the registration date and time we want to find out what the peak registration hours are.

* Ruby has [Date](https://rubyapi.org/2.7/o/date) and [Time](https://rubyapi.org/2.7/o/time) classes that will be very useful for this task.

* For a quick overview, check out this [Ruby Guides](https://www.rubyguides.com/2015/12/ruby-time/) article. 

* Explore the documentation to become familiar with the available methods, especially `#strptime`, `#strftime`, and `#hour`.

## Assignment: Day of the Week Targeting

The big boss gets excited about the results from your hourly tabulations. It
looks like there are some hours that are clearly more important than others.
But now, tantalized, she wants to know "What days of the week did most people
register?"

* Use [Date#wday](https://rubyapi.org/2.7/o/date#method-i-wday) to find out the day of the week.
