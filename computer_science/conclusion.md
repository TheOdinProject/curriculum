You deserve a pat on the back for how far you've come. This course has been mostly theoretical; with occasional mathematics sprinkled in, and you've slugged your way through like a champ. Although you're still only swimming by the coast in the vast ocean that is Computer Science; you've learned enough about how data structures work, and examples of some useful data structures to add to your toolkit.

You've also learned some core algorithms that are used from day to day in your programming life; even if you're not directly writing said algorithms. You also learned the core notation that allows you to distinguish, on a high level; the differences in performance between algorithms, and you should have some confidence in being able to understand and select the right tool for your needs.

Most importantly, these are concepts that are **not** exclusive to any language. The specific implementation might be, but the steps and pseudo-code you use for an algorithm will never change. You could be coding Ruby one week; and in the next week learning how to write code in Java and being able to implement your algorithms there. This makes you a much more flexible individual; and now the world suddenly becomes much more accessible.

So get out there, and really start learning the language specifics! Best of luck to you!
