### Introduction

Code. Code is written for our machines to execute but more importantly, it is written for us, humans, to understand.

You've seen some code by now, especially so if you were diligent and took the time to practice reading code by exploring projects written
by your peers going through The Odin Project. Some of it was good, some of it was bad but probably a lot of it was just confusing.
That's absolutely fine, of course - you're all still learning.

But what do professionals do to make sure their code is as best as it can be:
readable, predictable and performant? They try to come up with best practices.

You have already been exposed to some of the conventions in HTML, CSS, JS and Ruby.
This is whyJS has its variables written `likeThis` while Ruby's are `like_this`, why functions are verbs and variables are things like `do_something(with_thing, another_thing)`. Why there exists
a preference for getting rid of `if` statements, why some languages prefer loops while other prefer iterative approaches. Why some features
present in languages are strongly discouraged - remember `var`, `eval()` or `$global_variable`s?

Enter another set of tools: linters and formatters. In this case, you are going to be acquainted with something that does both:

RuboCop. A really polished gem that will make your code shine!
