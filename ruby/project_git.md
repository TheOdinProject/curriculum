# Project: Git Calisthenics
Total Estimated Time: TODO

TODO: Build the sample project and the instructions for students to go in and mess it up safely.

Stuff to cover:

* set up your git username
* check your configurations via a tour
* create a new repo, mess something up
* have to debug a merge conflict
* view logs... 
 
Best get this stuff out of the way on a toy project than your important one!  

Should have already done Try Git, else do that first.
