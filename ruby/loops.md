# Loops
Now that we have gotten our hands a little dirty with ruby, let's discuss the
concept of loops. Loops allow a program to execute particular tasks as
many times as needed to achieve a particular goal. This is important because
thousands of steps within a program can be completed within seconds, increasing
productivity and reducing the time and effort that would be required if a user
had to do it manually. Throughout this lesson you will learn about looping constructs, flow control and conditionals and why they are important concepts in computer programming.

## Learning outcomes
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

After completing this lesson you can expect to:

* Understand what a loop is and why its useful
* Know how to use a `while` loop in ruby
* Know how to use a `for` loop in ruby
* Know how to use the `loop` loop in ruby
* Know how use a `times` loop in ruby.
* Know how to use the `until` loop in ruby.
* Know how to use the `upto` and `downto` loops in ruby

## Assignment
1. Read through launchschool's chapter on [Loops and Iterators]
(https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/loops_iterators#simpleloop).
This chapter gives an excellent overview of 'while', 'until', 'do/while',
and the 'for' loops. For an extra challenge, do the Exercises section at the end
 of the chapter.
2. Read [zetcode's](http://zetcode.com/lang/rubytutorial/flowcontrol/) article covering control flow. It is a good overview going over loops and explaining how to control the flow of Ruby programs by using what's known as conditionals.
3. Check out lead Viking Erik Trautman's post, [Ruby Explained: Iteration](http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-iteration).

## Exercise
Link to external repo which will include exercises for this lesson which the user will complete by passing tests
