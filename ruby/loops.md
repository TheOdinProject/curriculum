# Loops
Now that we have gotten our hands a little dirty with ruby, let's discuss the
concept of loops. Loops allow a program to execute particular tasks as
many times as needed to achieve a particular goal. This is important because
thousands of steps within a program can be completed within seconds, increasing
productivity and reducing the time and effort that would be required if a user
had to do it manually. Put another way, loops are just a means of repeating an action, like saying "hello world" four times. The action is "hello world" and the set number is 4. Throughout this lesson, you will learn about looping constructs, flow control and conditionals and why they are important concepts in computer programming.

## Learning outcomes
*Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment*

After completing this lesson you can expect to:

* Understand what a loop is and why it's useful
* Know how to use a `while` loop in ruby
* Know how to use a `for` loop in ruby
* Know how to use the `loop` loop in ruby
* Know how to use a `times` loop in ruby.
* Know how to use the `until` loop in ruby.
* Know how to use the `upto` and `downto` loops in ruby

## Assignment
1. Read through launchschool's chapter on [Loops and Iterators]
(https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/loops_iterators#simpleloop).
This chapter gives an excellent overview of 'while', 'until', 'do/while',
and the 'for' loops. For an extra challenge, do the Exercises section at the end of the chapter.
2. Check out lead Viking Erik Trautman's post, [Ruby Explained: Iteration](http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-iteration).

## Exercise
Link to external rep which will include exercises for this lesson which the user will complete by passing tests
