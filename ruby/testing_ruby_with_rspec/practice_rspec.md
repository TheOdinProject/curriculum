### Introduction

Before getting into any big projects, you should have some practice with writing tests in RSpec. Learning is best done through doing after all! There are a lot of tests to go through and you have to refer to multiple files, but make sure to not feel too overwhelmed. We're all in this together!

For this section, you're first going to complete a lot of exercises involving test-writing, and then finally implementing tests into an old you've written.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Clone our [ruby testing repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/ruby_testing) and complete the lessons in the spec folder.
1. Go back to the [Caesar Cipher Project](/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher) and write tests for your code.  It shouldn't take more than a half-dozen tests to cover all the possible cases. As always, use the git workflow you learned in [Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) to work on a new feature so you can work on your new code without fear.
