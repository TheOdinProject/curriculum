# Project: Stock Picker

*Don't forget to use Git to save your projects!*

### Your Task

Implement a method `#stock_picker` that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day.  It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.  Days start at 0.

```language-bash
    > stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
    => [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```

**Quick Tips:**
* The index of the array of stock prices represents the day
* the value at each index represents the value of the stock on that day
* You need to buy before you can sell
* Pay attention to edge cases like when the lowest day is the last day or the highest day is the first day.
