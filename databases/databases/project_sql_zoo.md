### Introduction

SQL Zoo is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables.  Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions.  Some of the queries, particularly at first, are quite simple.  They definitely get more challenging towards the end and can be real head scratchers.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
  1.  Go to [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) and do Tutorials 0-9 listed under the "Tutorial Section" and the quizzes listed at the end of each.  The first is the ["Select" tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics).
      -   Make sure the dropdown on the upper right of the main page for "Engine" says "MySQL" (the default).  Large results will be cut off and not all rows or columns shown, so the "answers" may not look 100% correct.
  2.  Before you move on, we would like your feedback - [please fill this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenvMG6WFbOOEap_biQOwqfbH-j-xsf5Eyv4ir2Rx5FsYSecQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Getting user (you) feedback is important so we can continue to improve the curriculum and get an idea of your experience.
