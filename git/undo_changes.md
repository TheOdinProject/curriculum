# Undo Changes in Git
As mentioned in the [Git Intro lesson](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/introduction-to-git), Git keeps a historical record of all the changes in a project based on each commit that is made. This gives you the capabilities to do some very useful things with Git.

One of the most useful abilities is to undo changes in a project. There are many scenarios where this will be useful to you as a developer.

Imagine you have introduced a serious bug in a app you are working on in your latest commit. The bug is breaking the functionality that allows users to make orders. Every second this bug is allowed to be on the live version of the app is losing you money. The quickest way to fix this problem in many cases is to revert to a previous working commit in your project which doesn't have the bug.

Another more common scenario is you don't want the changes you have made in your last few commits and want to go back to how your project was before making these changes. With git you can simply reset to the commit previous to the commits that introduced your new changes.

In this lesson you will learn all of the different ways you can undo changes with Git. This is the next important ability you need to gain in your road to mastery with Git.
