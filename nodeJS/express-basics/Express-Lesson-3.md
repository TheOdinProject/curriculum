The next step in the MDN express tutorial sets up all the routes and controllers you're going to need when creating the Library project. This project is designed using the MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture. In a previous step you set up all the Models (or Database Objects) and in the _next_ step you'll be setting up several different views.

If you remember from our earlier lessons, a controller is, as you'll see the code that sits between the models and the views and determines which view is going to be shown and which information is going to populate that view. This lesson will have you copy and pasting quite a bit of repetitive code to get the controllers and routes set up, but be sure to read everything in between them!  There is a _lot_ of useful information in this lesson.
