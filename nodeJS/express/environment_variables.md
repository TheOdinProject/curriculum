### Introduction

When you run your code, your code runs in an individual environment. Run your code on a different machine? Different environment. Host your website somewhere like Netlify or Vercel? Different environment to your machine. Each environment is a unique collection of tools and configurations.

You will have certainly written many functions with parameters that each time you call them, you pass in different arguments. Depending on those arguments, the outcome may differ. Just like with function parameters, your applications themselves can make use of **environment variables**. When you run your code, you can pass in values to those environment variables, and you can pass in different values in different environments as necessary.
