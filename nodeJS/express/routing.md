### Introduction

In the previous lesson, we broke down a basic Express app and a request's journey through it. However, in a real app, we'd want to handle many different types of requests for different things.

Routes essentially just match a request's HTTP verb (e.g. `GET` or `POST`) and URL path to the appropriate set of middleware functions - the controllers. We will explore controllers and middleware in more detail in the next lesson. For now, let's dive into how we can use routes.
