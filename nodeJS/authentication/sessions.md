### Introduction

Now that we've been introduced to cookies and their various uses and properties, let's use them to help us implement authentication. We want to allow someone to log in once and let the server "remember" them, automatically recognizing any future requests from them.

The basic login process (with a username and password) is rather straightforward. The user submits a form with their username and password, then the server checks the database to see if that username/password combo exists. If it does, great - it knows who the requester is and can continue with the rest of the request. If it does not exist, it does not know who the requester is, so it can unauthorize the request.

So if someone does successfully "log in", how does the server recognize that the next request that user sends is coming from them? Without a system to persist the login, it'd just be a plain ol' request like any other and could have come from anyone. We *could* send the username and password with every request and authenticate that every time, but as you can imagine, this can be quite cumbersome. To handle this better, we will use **sessions**.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- Describe what sessions are.
- Explain how sessions and cookies can be used together to for session management to persit logins.
- Implement authentication with sessions.
- Explain how and why passwords are hashed before being stored.

### Sessions

<div class="lesson-note" markdown="1">

#### "Session management" and "sessions"

Note that from this lesson onwards, "session management" will refer to the general concept of persisting user interaction data between requests (like persisting a login), while "sessions" will refer specifically to the stateful solution discussed in this lesson. Later in the course, we will discuss other ways to handle session management that don't use stateful sessions.

</div>

A session is just information about a user's interaction with the site in a given time period and can be used to store a whole variety of data. To persist logins, we can store (serialize) some information about that user, such as their user ID, in a database table. That data will have its own ID and may also have an expiry time. We can then store that session's ID in a cookie (it doesn't need anything else stored in it) and send it back to the user in the server response.

The client now has that cookie with the session ID and can then attach it to any future requests. The server can then check the database for a valid session with the same ID it found in the cookie. If there is a matching session, great - it can extract the serialized user information (deserialize) and continue with the request now it knows who made it. If there is no matching or valid session, like with logging in, we don't know who the user is, so we can unauthorize the request.

This is exactly like having a name badge or access pass at work or some event. The cookie is like an access pass which you (the client) give to a machine or security (the server) and it checks who you are and if you're allowed in or not. You can go home and come back the next day, reusing that pass as many times as you need so long as you still have it and your details are still in the system.

### Implementing sessions

Let's use [express-session](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html) to implement a basic session authentication system - code along! For the purpose of streamlining our example, we'll put all of the JavaScript in `app.js` and start with hardcoding a few things. When it comes to your own projects, separate different parts like routes, controllers etc. to their own files and folders as you'll have done before. The same can be done for any configuration for authentication features.

#### Setup

First, make a new database within `psql`. We will start by setting up a `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  username VARCHAR ( 255 ),
  password VARCHAR ( 255 )
);
```

Now we'll set up a minimal Express app. We'll need the following dependencies installed first:

```bash
npm install express express-session ejs dotenv pg connect-pg-simple
```

Now our initial `index.ejs` view:

```ejs
<!-- views/index.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

And our `app.js`:

```javascript
// app.js
require("dotenv").config();
const path = require("node:path");
const { Pool } = require("pg");
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");
const pgSession = require("connect-pg-simple")(session);

const pool = new Pool({
  // add your db configuration
});

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const app = express();
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

app.use(session({
  store: new pgSession({
    pool: pool,
    createTableIfMissing: true,
  }),
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: isProduction,
    secure: isProduction,
    maxAge: 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 2 days
  },
}));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index");
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`App listening on port ${PORT}!`);
});
```

#### Session store

Let's talk about our session config which we apply to every incoming request (by mounting it on `app`). Firstly, we use the [connect-pg-simple](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-pg-simple) library to make express-session store session data in a "session" table in our database, creating the table if it does not already exist. Have a look at the [SQL queries for creating the session table](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple/blob/HEAD/table.sql), then go and look inside your database in psql to see what the session table looks like.

Inside the session table, you should see three columns: "sid", "sess" and "expire". These contain the session's ID, the data stored in the session, and its expiry time respectively.

#### Prevent unnecessary session saving

Then we turn off `resave` and `saveUninitialized`. For every request, express-session will automatically check if a valid session cookie is attached. If a valid session cookie is attached then it deserializes the session data, populating `req.session` with it - we will make use of this later. If no valid session cookie is attached to the request, it will instead create a brand new session object in `req.session`. At the end of the request-response cycle, if the session object has been modified in any way, the session will be saved to the database. Turning off `resave` and `saveUninitialized` makes sure we don't save any unmodified session objects to the database.

#### Session secret

We then set a **session secret** which we define in our `.env` file since it's, well, a secret. This should be some string that's hard to guess - you can use a random key generator online for this - and is used by express-session alongside the session ID to generate a hash and sign the resulting session cookie. Then if an attacker tries to tamper with a session cookie, the signature would no longer match and the server can invalidate it.

#### Cookie options

Lastly, we pass in options for the cookies that will be created by express-session. In our example, we set a 2-day expiry and conditionally set the `httpOnly` and `secure` properties so that they're only true when in production. This is so that when we're developing locally with localhost, we can still access the cookie via `document.cookie` on the front end if necessary, and still allow the cookie to be set over HTTP (we only want to limit the cookie to HTTPS connections when deployed).

### Creating users

<div class="lesson-note lesson-note--critical" markdown="1">

#### Validate your user input

For the sake of brevity, we're omitting the server-side validation step in this example. **Do not omit server-side validation in your projects.**

</div>

We will need a way for a user to create an account, so let's create a sign up form view:

```ejs
<!-- views/signup.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Sign up</title>
</head>
<body>
  <a href="/login">Log in</a>
  <h1>Sign up</h1>
  <form action="/signup" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input id="username" name="username" type="text" />
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input id="password" name="password" type="password" />
    <button>Sign Up</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

And corresponding `GET` and `POST` routes:

```javascript
app.get("/signup", (req, res) => {
  res.render("signup");
});

app.post("/signup", async (req, res, next) => {
  await pool.query(
    "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ($1, $2)",
    [req.body.username, req.body.password],
  );
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

Remember, we're omitting the validation step as well as storing the raw password - this is of course unsafe and is solely for demonstration purposes. Password hashing will be introduced later in this lesson. We have also not done anything to prevent duplicate usernames, so that's something for you to handle yourself in your projects. For now, you should be able to serve your app and visit `/signup`, submit the form and be redirected to the home view. Open your database in `psql` and query the users table to see your first user!

### Logging in

Now that we have the ability to put users in our database, let's allow them to log in to see a special greeting instead of the generic "Hello world!". We will need the following steps to occur:

1. Check if the submitted username and password match a user in our users table in our database.
1. If no match is found, end the request there, rejecting the login. Otherwise, serialize the user's ID to a new session.
1. Set a cookie with that session's ID.
1. Respond to the request with the cookie.

We'll need to start with the login logic itself, so let's create login routes. Remember we're doing everything together for demonstration purposes only; organize and extract code as you see fit.

```javascript
app.get("/login", (req, res) => {
  res.render("login");
});

app.post("/login", async (req, res, next) => {
  // query for a matching username
  const { rows } = await pool.query(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1",
    [req.body.username],
  );
  const user = rows[0];

  // if the user exists and the password matches...
  if (user?.password === req.body.password) {
    // serialize the user ID in the session object so it can be retrieved later
    req.session.userId = user.id;
    req.session.save((err) => {
      if (err) {
        next(err);
      } else {
        res.redirect("/");
      }
    });
  } else {
    res.render("login", {
      error: "Incorrect username or password",
    });
  }
});
```

What's going on here? First we have our route for rendering the login page. In our `POST` route, we query our db for the submitted username. If the username exists *and* the submitted password matches, we serialize the user ID to the session data, save the session to the database, then redirect to the homepage (if you've never seen `?.` before, check out [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)). Express-session will then automatically set the cookie and attach it to the response. For subsequent requests, this session (which will be retrieved from the session ID in the cookie) will contain the user ID, which we can use to authenticate.

If there is no matching username/password combo, we render the login page again with an error message. Note that we cannot serialize the user ID to `req.session.id` because [`req.session.id` is already used for the session's own ID](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html#reqsessionid).

We only need to serialize the user ID as that will never change for a user (unlike a username, which could be changed by a user if that feature is implemented). It's the only user info we'll need right now since later we'll write a middleware that uses the user ID to grab any other user info like the current username.

<div class="lesson-note lesson-note--warning" markdown="1">

#### Use generic login error messages

Don't specify which form fields are incorrect when providing validation feedback. Providing specific feedback can allow attackers to target accounts if they know a specific username exists, for example. It also means if you misspell your username but it happens to match someone else's username, you're less likely to be misled into thinking you entered your username correctly.

</div>

Let's create the login page:

```ejs
<!-- views/login.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Login</title>
</head>
<body>
  <a href="/signup">Sign up</a>
  <h1>Please log in</h1>
  <form action="/login" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input id="username" name="username" type="text">
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input id="password" name="password" type="password">
    <button>Log in</button>
  </form>
  <% if (locals.error) { %>
    <p><%= error %></p>
  <% } %>
</body>
</html>
```

And edit the homepage to show a personalized greeting with a logout button (which we will implement later):

```ejs
<!-- views/index.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, <%= username %>!</h1>
  <form action="/logout" method="POST">
    <button>Log out</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### Handling requests after login

As of now, our `GET /` route will always display the homepage and will crash if someone has not yet logged in! There would not be a cookie and therefore no session to deserialize, so `req.session` would contain a fresh session object without any user properties. We can write a middleware that checks `req.session` and if it has a user ID in it, we can use it to query the db and grab any user info we need, then continue to the homepage. Otherwise, the user is not authenticated and we can redirect to the login page.

```javascript
async function checkAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.session.userId) {
    res.redirect("/login");
    return;
  }

  // if there is a user ID in the session, grab that matching user
  const { rows } = await pool.query(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1",
    [req.session.userId],
  );
  // add the user details we need to req
  // so we can access it in the next middleware
  req.user = {
    id: rows[0].id,
    username: rows[0].username,
  };
  next();
}
```

Plonk it in our `GET /` route as the first middleware and there we go!

```javascript
app.get("/", checkAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  res.render("index", { username: req.user.username });
});
```

If you serve your app and go to the site on localhost, you should be redirected to `/login` straight away since you won't yet have a session cookie. You should already have a user in your database, so log in with your credentials and see your personalized greeting!

We can add our `checkAuthenticated` middleware to any routes that we need authenticate, or even as router-level middleware for example. You can of course customize this function however you wish - the code shown here is just for our example app.

### Logging out

A user is only "logged in" because their requests have a session cookie attached containing an ID matching a valid session in our db. So to "log out", we can just destroy the session in our database, which will automatically invalidate the client cookie since it will no longer match any sessions.

To destroy the session, express-session gives us a lovely `req.session.destroy` function. We give it a callback run after the destruction occurs - if there was an error destroying the session, pass control to the error handler middleware, otherwise, redirect to the login page. Since the session was destroyed, if a user tried to access the `GET /` route, they would not be authenticated and so would be redirected to the login page.

```javascript
app.post("/logout", (req, res, next) => {
  req.session.destroy((err) => {
    if (err) {
      next(err);
    } else {
      res.redirect("/login");
    }
  });
});
```

We should have a working app that allows new users to sign up, log in and log out. Try it out before we move on to talk about password security.

### Storing passwords securely

The most secure way to store passwords? Don't. Offloading that responsibility to other systems by letting users log in with their Facebook or Google accounts means you won't need to store passwords on your side at all. That being said, that's very much out of scope right now and doesn't really help us with learning these fundamentals behind the scenes.

By far the worst way we can store passwords is to just store them in plaintext like we've done in our example app earlier. Even if we encrypted the passwords, all an attacker would need is the key to decrypt all the passwords. Let's face it, if someone managed to gain access to your database, it probably wouldn't be very hard for them to get the encryption key (assuming they don't already have it).

Remember [hash functions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap-data-structure#what-is-a-hash-code) from the Hashmap lesson? We want to hash our passwords, then store the hash since hashes are one-way functions. We also want to [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) the password when hashing so that the identical passwords will produce a different hash each time, preventing attackers from comparing hashes against precomputed hashes of common passwords (often referred to as "rainbow tables"). There are many more things to account for and that's why we have purpose-built algorithms for hashing passwords, such as argon2.

#### Argon2

All of this can be done for us via the [argon2 npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argon2). Fortunately for us, using it doesn't require that much extra work. Going back to our `POST /signup` middleware, let's hash our password before we store it:

```bash
npm install argon2
```

```javascript
const argon2 = require("argon2");

app.post("/signup", async (req, res, next) => {
  const hashedPassword = await argon2.hash(req.body.password);
  await pool.query(
    "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ($1, $2)",
    [req.body.username, hashedPassword],
  );
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

We don't need to modify any of its options, as the defaults all meet the [password storage recommendations set by OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction) (Open Worldwide Application Security Project). Now in our `POST /login` middleware, we can also use argon2 to verify the submitted password against the stored salted hash:

```javascript
app.post("/login", async (req, res, next) => {
  const { rows } = await pool.query(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1",
    [req.body.username],
  );
  const user = rows[0];

  // argon2.verify requires an argon2 hash as its first arg
  // so we can't just pass in `undefined` if no user exists.
  // The hash itself doesn't matter as long as it's a valid argon2 hash
  // since this is to prevent timing attacks if no user is found
  const isMatchingPassword = await argon2.verify(
    user?.password ?? process.env.FALLBACK_HASH,
    req.body.password,
  );
  if (user && isMatchingPassword) {
    req.session.userId = user.id;
    req.session.save((err) => {
      if (err) {
        next(err);
      } else {
        res.redirect("/");
      }
    });
  } else {
    res.render("login", {
      error: "Incorrect username or password",
    });
  }
});
```

Now, when a user signs up, their password is salted and hashed before storage, which is then used to verify the password upon login.

<div class="lesson-note lesson-note--warning" markdown="1">

#### Timing attacks

Why does the `POST /login` middleware force `argon2.verify` to run even when no user is found in our database? Why can't we just early return if no user found?

Just like with [using generic login error messages](#use-generic-login-error-messages), we don't want to reveal that a username is valid and only the corresponding password is incorrect. If no user is found and we return early, then the server will respond quicker than if it had to verify the password against a hash (`argon2.verify` is already designed to account for timing attacks). Attackers could use this timing difference to determine whether a username exists or not, allowing them to focus their efforts on certain usernames - a timing attack.

You don't need to know all the details of specific attack techniques but in this case, it doesn't take much to ensure that the same process always runs regardless of whether a user exists or not.
