### A simple Node website!

You should know enough to be dangerous now... There's *definitely* more to learn but you already know enough about Node to actually make something!  So lets do it!

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. create a very basic informational site with 4 pages: index, about and contact-me and 404.  The content of these pages isn't really all that important so don't waste a ton of time filling them up or making them pretty.
2. Create a project directory and inside it create your 4 html files and name them appropriately:
    - index.html
    - about.html
    - contact-me.html
    - 404.html
3. Create your node.js server file and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.
    - [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) should take users to index.html
    - [localhost:8080/about](http://localhost:8080/about) should take users to about.html
    - [localhost:8080/contact-me](http://localhost:8080/contact-me) should take users to contact-me.html
    - 404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page that is _not_ one of the above 3.
