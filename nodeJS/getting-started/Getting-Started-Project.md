### A simple Node website!

By now you should know enough to be dangerous. There's *definitely* more to learn but you already know enough about Node to actually make something! So lets do it! You will be creating a very basic informational site that contains 4 pages: index, about, contact-me and 404. Keep in mind that the content of these pages isn't really all that important. So there's no need to spend a lot of time filling them up or trying to make them look pretty. With that said, if you are feeling inspired, feel free to go all out with this project but it's not required.

If you get stuck at anytime, feel free to go back to the tutorial you did in the previous lesson.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">

1. Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
    - index.html
    - about.html
    - contact-me.html
    - 404.html

2. Create your node.js server file and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.
    - [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) should take users to index.html
    - [localhost:8080/about](http://localhost:8080/about) should take users to about.html
    - [localhost:8080/contact-me](http://localhost:8080/contact-me) should take users to contact-me.html
    - 404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
