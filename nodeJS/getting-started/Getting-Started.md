Node.js is really just JavaScript.. so most of what you need to know to be productive you have already learned by going through our prerequisite javascript course. (If you *haven't* gone through that yet, now would be a fine time to actually do that)

This lesson will take you through a tutorial that will teach you the basic modules and functions that you need to get up and running with node.js.  The project that comes right after this assignment will ask you to use node to create a basic informational website with 3 pages, an index, about and contact-me.. so be on the lookout for things that might help you do just that.
