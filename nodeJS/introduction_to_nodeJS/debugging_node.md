### Introduction

Up until this point, you may have only relied on the browser's DevTools to debug your code. When it comes to debugging Node and server side code, VS Code has a handy built-in debugger that you can use to debug directly in your editor! Hopefully you'll have also made use of this at some points earlier in the curriculum already, but ultimately, this lesson will familiarize you with the VS Code Node debugger, which is a critical tool at this point in your learning, and will likely be a key tool you use daily in your professional life.
