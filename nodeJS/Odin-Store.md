Create a fake ecommerce app that uses a fake currency API (that we'll provide).

Users can see the store's offerings, can sign in, add items to a shopping cart, view that cart and check out using their odin-bucks account.

The store should have departments or categories so users can view and sort items by category (i.e. clothing > mens)

Users should be able to add ratings and reviews to items, and should be able to log into a dashboard and see all past orders.
